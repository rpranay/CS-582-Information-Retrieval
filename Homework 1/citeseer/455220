Closing the Loop: an Agenda- and Justification-Based Framework for Selecting the Next Discovery Task to Perform We propose and evaluate an agenda- and justificationbased  architecture for discovery systems that contains  a mechanism for selecting the next task to perform.  This framework has many desirable properties: (1) its  use of heuristics to perform and propose tasks  facilitates the use of general discovery strategies that  are able to use a variety of background knowledge, (2)  through the use of justifications its mechanism for  selecting the next task to perform is able to reason  about the appropriateness of the tasks being  considered, and (3) its mechanism for selecting the  next task to perform also considers the users interests,  allowing a discovery program to tailor its behavior  toward them.  We evaluate the extent to which both reasons and  estimates of interestingness contribute to performance  in the domain of protein crystallization. With both  aspects contributing to task selection, a high fraction  of discoveries by the HAMB prototype were judged  interesting by an expert (21% interesting and novel;  45% interesting but rediscoveries).  1.
