From Design to Intention: Signs of a Revolution ce such environment and be influenced by it.  ii. openness: software systems will be subject to decentralized management and will dynamically change their structure: new components can be dynamically created or destroyed and, via mobility, will be able, to roam in and out the permeable boundaries of different software systems. Thus, the problem of openness is currently much broader than being simply a problem of interoperability;  iii. locality in control: the components of software systems will represent autonomous loci of control. In fact, most components of software systems will be active, and will have local control over their activities, although will be in need of coordinating these activities with other active components.  iv. locality in interactions: despite living in a fully connected world, software components interact with each other accordingly to local (geographical or logical) patterns. In other words, systems will have to be modeled around clusters of locally interactin
