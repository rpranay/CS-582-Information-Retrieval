Building Domain-Specific Search Engines with Machine Learning Techniques Domain-specific search engines are becoming increasingly popular because they offer increased accuracy and extra features not possible with the general, Web-wide search engines. For example, www.campsearch.com allows complex queries by agegroup, size, location and cost over summer camps. Unfortunately, these domain-specific search engines are difficult and time consuming to maintain. This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific search engines. We describe new research in reinforcement learning, text classification and information extraction that automates efficient spidering, populating topic hierarchies, and identifying informative text segments. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a search engine for computer science research papers. It already contains over 33,000 papers and is publicly available at  www.cora.jprc.com. 1 Introduction  As the amount of information on the World ...
