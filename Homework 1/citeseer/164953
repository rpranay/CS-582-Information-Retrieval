Computational Logic and Machine Learning: A roadmap for Inductive Logic Programming Computational logic has already significantly influenced (symbolic) machine learning through the field of inductive logic programming (ILP) which is concerned with the induction of logic programs from examples and background knowledge. In ILP, the shift of attention from program synthesis to knowledge discovery resulted in advanced techniques that are practically applicable for discovering knowledge in relational databases. Machine learning, and ILP in particular, has the potential to influence computational logic by providing an application area full of industrially significant problems, thus providing a challenge for other techniques in computational logic. This paper gives a brief introduction to ILP, presents state-of-the-art ILP techniques for relational knowledge discovery as well as some research and organizational directions for further developments in this area. 1 Introduction  Inductive logic programming (ILP) [35, 39, 29] is a research area that has its backgrounds in induct...
