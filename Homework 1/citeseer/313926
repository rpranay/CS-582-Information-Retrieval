Modeling Spatial Dependencies for Mining Geospatial Data: An Introduction Spatial data mining is a process to discover interesting, potentially useful and high utility  patterns embedded in spatial databases. Efficient tools for extracting information from spatial  data sets can be of importance to organizations which own, generate and manage large spatial  data sets. The current approach towards solving spatial data mining problems is to use classical  data mining tools after "materializing" spatial relationships. However, the key property of  spatial data is that of spatial autocorrelation. Like temporal data, spatial data values are  influenced by values in their immediate vicinity. Ignoring spatial autocorrelation in the modeling  process leads to results which are a poor-fit and unreliable. In this chapter we will first review  spatial statistical techniques which explictly model spatial autocorrelation. Second, we will  propose PLUMS(Predicting Locations Using Map Similarity), a new approach for supervised  spatial data mining problems. PLUMS searches the space of solutions using a map-similarity  measure which is more appropriate in the context of spatial data. We will show that compared  to state-of-the-art spatial statistics approaches, PLUMS achives comparable accuracy but at  a fraction of the computational cost. Furthermore, PLUMS provides a general framework for  specializing other data mining techniques for mining spatial data.
