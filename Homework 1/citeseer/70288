Simultaneous Learning of Negatively Correlated Neural Networks A new approach to designing neural network ensembles has been proposed recently [1]. Experimental studies on some regression tasks have shown that the new approach performs significantly better than previous ones [1]. This paper presents a new algorithm for designing neural network ensembles for classification problems with noise. This new algorithm is different from that used for regression tasks although the idea is similar. The idea behind this new algorithm is to encourage different individual networks in an ensemble to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the whole ensemble can learn the whole training data better. Negatively correlated networks are trained with a novel correlation penalty term in the error function to encourage such specialisation. In our algorithm, individual networks are trained simultaneously rather than sequentially. This provides an opportunity for different networks to interact with other and to specialise. Experiments on two real-w...
