A Formal Approach to Detecting Security Flaws in Object-Oriented Databases this paper is to show an efficient decision algorithm for detecting a security flaw under a given authorization. This problem is solvable in polynomial time in practical cases by reducing it to the congruence closure problem. This paper also mentions the problem of finding a maximal subset of a given authorization under which no security flaw exists.
