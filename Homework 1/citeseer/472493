Search History for User Support in Information-Seeking Interfaces The research overview described focuses on the design of search history displays to support information seeking (IS). It examines users' IS activities, current and potential use of histories, and building on this theoretical framework, assesses prototype interfaces that integrate these histories into search systems. Preliminary results described indicate search history use in coordinated work, mental model building, and end user IS strategies. Searchers create and use external records of their actions and the corresponding results by writing/typing notes, using copy and paste functions, and making printouts. Recording user actions and results in computerized systems automates this process, and enables the creation of search history displays that support users in their IS. Existing systems provide search history capabilities, however these often do not offer enough flexibility for users. Legal information has been selected as the domain for the research.
