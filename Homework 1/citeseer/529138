Current approaches to the development of cooperative information  systems are based on services to be offered by cooperating organizations,  and on the opportunity of building coordinators and brokers  on top of such services. The quality of data exchanged and provided by  different services hampers such approaches, as data of low quality can  spread all over the cooperative system. At the same time, improvement  can be based on comparing data, correcting them and disseminating high  quality data. In this paper, a service-based framework for managing data  quality in cooperative information systems is presented. An XML-based  model for data and quality data is proposed, and the design of a broker  for data, which selects the best available data from different services, is  presented. Such a broker also supports the improvement of data based on  feedbacks to source services.
