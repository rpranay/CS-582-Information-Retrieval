The Morph Node We discuss potential and limitations of a Morph Node, inspired by the corresponding construct in Java3D. A Morph Node in Java3D interpolates vertex attributes among several homeomorphic geometries. This node is a promising candidate for the delivery of 3D animation in a very compact form. We review the state-of-the-art in Web 3D techniques, allowing for the possibility of interpolating among several geometries. This review leads to a simple extension for VRML-97 as well as a recommendation for necessary changes in Java3D. Furthermore, we discuss various optimization issues for Morph Nodes.
