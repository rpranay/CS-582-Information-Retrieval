SI-Designer: an Integration Framework for E-Commerce Electronic commerce lets people purchase goods  and exchange information on business transactions  on-line. Therefore one of the main challenges for  the designers of the e-commerce infrastructures is  the information sharing, retrieving data located in  different sources thus obtaining an integrated view  to overcome any contradiction or redundancy. Virtual  Catalogs synthesize this approach as they are  conceived as instruments to dynamically retrieve  information from multiple catalogs and present  product data in a unified manner, without directly  storing product data from catalogs.  In this paper we propose SI-Designer, a support  tool for the integration of data from structured and  semi-structured data sources, developed within the  MOMIS (Mediator environment for Multiple Information  Sources) project.  1
