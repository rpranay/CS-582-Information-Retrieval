Flexible Queries to Semi-structured Datasources: the WG-log Approach A line of research is presented aimed at specifying both logical and navigational aspects of semi-structured data sources such as Web sites through the unifying notion of schema. Gracefully supporting schemata that are huge or subject to change, the WG-Log language allows for a uniform representation of queries and views, the latter expressing customized access structures to site information. A survey of related work and some directions for future research involving fuzzy query techniques are also outlined. 1 Introduction and Motivations Modern network-oriented information systems often have to deal with data that are semi-structured, i.e. lack the strict, regular, and complete structure required by traditional database management systems (see [Abi97] and [Suc97] for a survey on semi-structured data and related research). Information is semi-structured also when the structure of data varies w.r.t. time, rather than w.r.t. space: even if data is fairly well structured, such struc...
