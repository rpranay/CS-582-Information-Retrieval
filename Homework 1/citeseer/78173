Graph Structured Views and Their Incremental Maintenance We study the problem of maintaining materialized views of graph structured data. The base data consists of records containing identifiers of other records. The data could represent traditional objects (with methods, attributes, and a class hierarchy), but it could also represent a lower level data structure. We define simple views and materialized views for such graph structured data, analyzing options for representing record identity and references in the view. We develop incremental maintenance algorithms for these views.  1 Introduction  Relational views are useful for controlling data access, specifying contents of caches (or remote copies), and other data management tasks. In this paper we study how to extend this view concept and the associated maintenance algorithms to what we call a graph structured database (GSDB). Informally, a GSDB is a collection of "objects" that may contain "pointers" (graph edges) to other objects. A GSDB can represent Web pages, Lotus Notes documents, o...
