Using Process Algebras to Formally Specify Mobile Agent Data Integrity Properties: a Case Study This paper shows how cryptographic protocols for mobile agent data integrity properties can be formally specified by using spi calculus, an extension of # calculus with cryptographic properties. In particular, by means of a case study, it is shown how a specification technique initially conceived only for classical cryptographic protocols can be used in the context of mobile agents as well. Our case study includes the spi calculus specification of a sample mobile agent data integrity protocol and of its security property.
