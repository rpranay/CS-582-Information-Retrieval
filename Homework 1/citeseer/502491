Agents Acting and Moving in Healthcare Scenario: A Paradigm for Telemedical Collaboration The present paper describes a novel approach to the analysis and development of telemedicine systems, based on the multi-agent paradigm. An agent is an autonomous, social, reactive and proactive entity, sometimes also mobile. Since telemedicine is grounded on communication and sharing of resources, agents are suitable for its analysis and implementation, and we adopted them for developing a prototype telemedical agent.
