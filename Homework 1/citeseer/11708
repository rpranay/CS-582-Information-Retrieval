Conflicts in a Simple Autonomy-Based Multi-Agent System This paper shows that, in some situations, conflict can deliberately be left in an autonomy-based multi-agent system. This study, supported by experimental results, has two major outcomes. First, it proves that conflict does not necessarily alter the global outcome of the system in a qualitative way. Second, it shows that it is possible to effect the way the global task is achieved by appropriately modifying the environment of the agents. Introduction  Our work fits in the framework of Bottom-Up Artificial Intelligence (Brooks 1986), (Brooks 1991) and more particularly, in that of Autonomous Agents (Pfeifer 1995). We are concerned with collective phenomena and their issues and more precisely, the way to carry out solutions that allow an autonomy-based multi-agent system to achieve a global task by virtue of emergence and self-organization. Emergence offers indeed a bridge between the necessity of complex and adaptive behavior at a macro level (the one of the system) and situationbased ...
