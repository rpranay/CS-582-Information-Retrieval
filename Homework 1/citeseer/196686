Text Categorization Using Weight Adjusted k-Nearest Neighbor Classification . Automatic text categorization is an important task that can  help people finding information on huge online resources. Text categorization  presents unique challenges due to the large number of attributes  present in the data set, large number of training samples, attribute dependency,  and multi-modality of categories. Existing classification techniques  have limited applicability in the data sets of these natures. In this  paper, we present a Weight Adjusted k-Nearest Neighbor (WAKNN)  classification that learns feature weights based on a greedy hill climbing  technique. We also present two performance optimizations of WAKNN  that improve the computational performance by a few orders of magnitude,  but do not compromise on the classification quality. We experimentally  evaluated WAKNN on 52 document data sets from a variety  of domains and compared its performance against several classification  algorithms, such as C4.5, RIPPER, Naive-Bayesian, PEBLS and VSM.  Experimental results ...
