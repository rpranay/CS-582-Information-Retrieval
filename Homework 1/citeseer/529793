S-CREAM -- Semi-automatic CREAtion of Metadata Abstract. Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitute the basis for the Semantic Web. We provide a framework, S-CREAM, that allows for creation of metadata and is trainable for a specific domain. Annotating web documents is one of the major techniques for creating metadata on the web. The implementation of S-CREAM, OntoMat supports now the semi-automatic annotation of web pages. This semi-automatic annotation is based on the information extraction component Amilcare. OntoMat extract with the help of Amilcare knowledge structure from web pages through the use of knowledge extraction rules. These rules are the result of a learningcycle based on already annotated pages. 1
