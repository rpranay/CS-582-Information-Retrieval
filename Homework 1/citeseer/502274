Interpretation of Shape-related Iconic Gestures in Virtual Environments The interpretation of iconic gestures in spatial domains is a promising idea to improve the communicative capabilities of human-computer interfaces. So far, approaches towards gesture recognition focused mainly on deictic and emblematic gestures. Iconics, viewed as iconic signs in the sense of Peirce, are different from deictics and emblems, for their relation to the referent is based on similarity. In the work reported here, the breakdown of the complex notion of similarity provides the key idea towards a computational model of gesture semantics for iconic gestures. Based on an empirical study,we describe first steps towards a recognition model for shape-related iconic gestures and its implementation in a prototype gesture recognition system. Observations are focused on spatial concepts and their relation to features of iconic gestural expressions. The recognition model is based on a graphmatching method which compares the decomposed geometrical structures of gesture and object.
