Webmining: Learning from the World Wide Web : Automated analysis of the world wide web is a new challenging area relevant in many applications, e.g., retrieval, navigation and organization of information, automated information assistants, and e-commerce. This paper discusses the use of unsupervised and supervised learning methods for user behavior modeling and content-based segmentation and classification of web pages. The modeling is based on independent component analysis and hierarchical probabilistic clustering techniques.  Keywords: Webmining, unsupervised learning, hierarchical probabilistic clustering 1.
