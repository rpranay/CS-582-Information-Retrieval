Agent-Based Programming Language for Multi-Agent Teams This report specifies a programming language for multi-agent teams. The language aims at providing an abstract level approach to the programming of teams composed of either software or hardware agents (e.g., robots), encapsulating the lower level implementation details (e.g., graphical primitives for icon animation, robot motion primitives) and providing an abstraction level appropriate for multi-agent systems. The overall architecture of the multi-agent team, the language specifications and an example of application to robotic soccer are included.
