Variorum: A Multimedia-Based Program Documentation System Conventional software documentation systems are mostly based on textutal descriptions that explain or annotate the program's source code. Typically they also support interactive browsing of high-level control flows, and name-based searching of program primitives such as variable declarations and function definitions. Because these systems rely solely on texts, it is difficult for program authors to describe overall algorithm structures and detailed implementation considerations of the programs in an interactive and flexible fashion. Variorum is a novel software documentation system that allows program authors to record the process of "walking through" their own code using multimedia technology, specifically, text, audio, and digital pen drawing. This approach greatly improves the interactivity and flexibility in the software documentation process. In addition, to broaden its applicability and to reduce the implementation complexity,  Variorum is designed to inter-operate with the WWW t...
