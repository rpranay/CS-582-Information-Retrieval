A Framework for Ontology Integration One of the basic problems in the development of techniques for the semantic  web is the integration of ontologies. Indeed, the web is constituted by a variety of  information sources, each expressed over a certain ontology, and in order to extract  information from such sources, their semantic integration and reconciliation in terms  of a global ontology is required. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem  of how to specify the mapping between the global ontology and the local ontologies.  We argue that for capturing such mapping in an appropriate way, the notion of query  is a crucial one, since it is very likely that a concept in one ontology corresponds  to a view (i.e., a query) over the other ontologies. As a result query processing in  ontology integration systems is strongly related to view-based query answering in data  integration.  1
