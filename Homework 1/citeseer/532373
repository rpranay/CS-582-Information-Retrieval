A Hybrid Mobile Robot Architecture with Integrated Planning and Control Research in the planning and control of mobile robots has received much attention in the past two decades. Two basic approaches have emerged from these research efforts: deliberative vs. reactive. These two approaches can be distinguished by their different usage of sensed data and global knowledge, speed of response, reasoning capability, and complexity of computation. Their strengths are complementary and their weaknesses can be mitigated by combining the two approaches in a hybrid architecture. This paper describes a method for goal-directed, collision-free navigation in unpredictable environments that employs a behavior-based hybrid architecture with asynchronously operating behavioral modules. It differs from existing hybrid architectures in two important ways: (1) the planning module produces a sequence of checkpoints instead of a conventional complete path, and (2) in addition to obstacle avoidance, the reactive module also performs target reaching under the control of a self-organizing neural network. The neural network is trained to perform fine, smooth motor control that moves the robot through the checkpoints. These two aspects facilitate a tight integration between high-level planning and low-level control, which permits real-time performance and easy path modification even when the robot is en route to the goal position.
