Overview of Datalog Extensions with Tuples and Sets Datalog (with negation) is the most powerful query language for relational database with a well-defined declarative semantics based on the work in logic programming. However, Datalog only allows inexpressive flat structures and cannot directly support complex values such as nested tuples and sets common in novel database applications. For these reasons, Datalog has been extended in the past several years to incorporate tuple and set constructors. In this paper, we examine four different Datalog extensions: LDL, COL, Hilog and Relationlog. 1 Introduction  Databases and logic programming are two independently developed areas in computer science. Database technology has evolved in order to effectively and efficiently organize, manage and maintain large volumes of ever increasingly complex data reliably in various memory devices. The underlying structure of databases has been the primary focus of research which leads to the development of data models. The most well-known and widely used da...
