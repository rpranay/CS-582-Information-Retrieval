Towards Efficient Multi-Feature Queries in Heterogeneous Environments Applications like multimedia databases or enterprisewide information management systems have to meet the challenge of efficiently retrieving best matching objects from vast collections of data. We present a new algorithm Stream-Combine for processing multi-feature queries on heterogeneous data sources. Stream-Combine is selfadapting to different data distributions and to the specific kind of the combining function. Furthermore we present a new retrieval strategy that will essentially speed up the output of relevant objects.
