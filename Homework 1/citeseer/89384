Scalability In Formal Concept Analysis This paper presents the results of experiments carried out with a set of 4,000 medical discharge summaries in which were recognised 1,962 attributes from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). In this domain, the objects are medical documents (4,000) and the attributes are UMLS terms extracted from the documents (1,962). When Formal Concept Analysis is used to iteratively analyse and visualize this data, complexity and scalability become critically important. Although the amount of data used in this experiment is small compared with the size of primary memory in modern computers, the results are still important since the probability distributions which determine the efficiencies are likely to remain stable as the size of the data is increased. Our work presents two outcomes, firstly we present a methodology for exploring knowledge in text documents using Formal Concept Analysis by employing conceptual scales created as the result of direct manipulation of a line diagram. The conceptual scales lead to small derived purified contexts that are represented using nested line diagrams. Secondly, we present an algorithm for the fast determination of purified contexts from a compressed representation of the large formal context. Our work draws on existing encoding and compression techniques to show how rudimentary data analysis can lead to substantial efficiency improvements to knowledge visualisation. c fl 1993 Blackwell Publishers, 238 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA, and 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 1JF, UK.
