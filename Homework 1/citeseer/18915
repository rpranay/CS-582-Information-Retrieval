Logic Programs for Intelligent Web Search . We present a general framework for the information extraction from web pages based on a special wrapper language, called token-templates. By using token-templates in conjunction with logic programs we are able to reason about web page contents, search and collect facts and derive new facts from various web pages. We give a formal definition for the semantics of logic programs extended by token-templates and define a general answer-completecalculus for these extendedprograms. These methodsand techniquesare used to build intelligent mediators and web information systems.  Keywords: information extraction; template based wrappers; mediators; logic programming; theory reasoning; deductive web databases; softbots; logic robots  1. Introduction  In the last few years it became appearant that there is an increasing need for more intelligent World-Wide-Web information systems. The existing information systems are mainly document search engines, e.g. Alta Vista, Yahoo, Webcrawler, based on in...
