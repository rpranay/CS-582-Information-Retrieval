Shopbots and Pricebots Shopbots are agents that automatically search the Internet to obtain information about prices and other attributes of goods and services. They herald a future in which autonomous agents profoundly influence electronic markets. In this study, a simple economic model is proposed and analyzed, which is intended to quantify some of the likely impacts of a proliferation of shopbots and other economically-motivated software agents. In addition, this paper reports on simulations of pricebots --- adaptive, pricesetting agents which firms may well implement to combat, or even take advantage of, the growing community of shopbots. This study forms part of a larger research program that aims to provide insights into the impact of agent technology on the nascent information economy.  1 Introduction  Shopbots, agents that automatically search the Internet for goods and/or services on behalf of consumers, herald a future in which autonomous agents become an essential component of nearly every facet o...
