Path Constraints on Deterministic Graphs We study path constraints for deterministic graph model [9], a variation of semistructured data model in which data is represented as a rooted edge-labeled directed graph with deterministic edge relations. The path constraint languages considered include the class of word constraints introduced in [4], the language P c investigated in [8], and an extension of P c defined in terms of regular expressions. Complexity results on the implication and finite implication problems for these constraint languages are established. 1 Introduction  Semistructured data is characterized as having no type constraints, irregular structure and rapidly evolving or missing schema [1, 6]. Examples of such data can be found on the WorldWide -Web, in biological databases and after data integration. In particular, documents of XML (eXtensible Markup Language [5]) can also be viewed as semistructured data [10]. The unifying idea in modeling semistructured data is the representation of data as an edge-labeled, r...
