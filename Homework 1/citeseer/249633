Requirements for a Translation between Knowledge-level Messages and the Database Structure This paper discusses the requirements of a translator between queries and assertions based on database-independent conceptualizations and their equivalents in the terms of the database structure. To cope with a large number of independent developers of software components that will have to access these databases, and who have different backgrounds and expertise, this translator will allow for several conceptualizations and vocabularies to coexist. It will be possible to individually customize these conceptualizations to keep them simple, concise, and well-aligned to the conceptualizations and jargon used by the domain experts. The translator will be accessed by other software components of the CRISTAL system that have to execute complex queries, like the Viewpoint Facility, user-supplied components ("User Code"), and the so-called ICIST GUI [6]. Schema-independent updates are most relevant for the user-supplied components.
