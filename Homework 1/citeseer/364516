Report on the TREC-8 Experiment: Searching on the Web and in Distributed Collections this paper verifies whether or not hyperlinks improve retrieval effectiveness. In the second chapter, we describe experiments on the ad hoc track. In this case, we acknowledge that currently it is becoming more and more difficult to store and manage the growing document collections within a single computer. Recent advances in network technology do however allow us to disseminate information sources by partitioning a single huge corpus (or distributing heterogeneous collections) over a local-area network (Intranet). Most retrieval mechanisms currently proposed however are based on conventional IR models [Salton 89], and where a centralized document collection is assumed.
