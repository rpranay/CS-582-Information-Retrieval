Analog Neural Nets with Gaussian or other Common Noise Distributions cannot Recognize Arbitrary Regular Languages We consider recurrent analog neural nets where the output of each gate is subject to Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution that is nonzero on a large set. We show that many regular languages cannot be recognized by networks of this type, and we give a precise characterization of those languages which can be recognized. This result implies severe constraints on possibilities for constructing recurrent analog neural nets that are robust against realistic types of analog noise. On the other hand we present a method for constructing feedforward analog neural nets that are robust with regard to analog noise of this type. 1 Introduction  A fairly large literature (see [Omlin, Giles, 1996] and the references therein) is devoted to the construction of analog neural nets that recognize regular languages. Any physical realization of the analog computational units of an analog neural net in technological or biological systems is bound to encounter some form of "imprecision" or an...
