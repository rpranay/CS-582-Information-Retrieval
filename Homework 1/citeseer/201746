Incremental and Interactive Sequence Mining The discovery of frequent sequences in temporal databases is an important data mining problem. Most current work assumes that the database is static, and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a) database updates, and b) user interaction (e.g. modifying mining parameters). This is a very challenging task, since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce new ones. In both the above scenarios, we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset, thereby reducing execution time. Experimental results confirm that our approach results in substantial performance gains. 1 Introduction  Sequence mining is an important data mining task, where one attempts to discover frequent sequences over time, of attribute sets in large databases. This problem was originally motivated by applications in the retailing industry, including...
