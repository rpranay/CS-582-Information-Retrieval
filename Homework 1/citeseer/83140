Improving Performance Of Case-Based Classification Using Context-Based Relevance Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. Thus, the way similarity among instances is measured is crucial for the success of the system. In case-based reasoning, it is assumed that similar problems have similar solutions. The case-based approach to classification is founded on retrieving cases from the case base that are similar to a given problem, and associating the problem with the class containing the most similar cases. Similarity-based retrieval tools can advantageously be used in building flexible retrieval and classification systems. Case-based classification uses previously classified instances to label unknown instances with proper classes. Classification accuracy is affected by the retrieval process -- the more relevant the instances used for classification, the greater the accuracy. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is bas...
