Logic-Based User-Defined Aggregates for the Next Generation of Database Systems this paper, we provide logic-based foundations for the extended aggregate constructs required by advanced database applications. In particular, we focus on data mining applications and show that they require user-defined aggregates extended with early returns. Thus, we propose a simple formalization of extended user-defined aggregates using the nondeterministic construct of choice. We obtain programs that have a formal semantics based on the concept of total stable models, but are also amenable to efficient implementation. Our formalization leads to a simple syntactic characterization of user-defined aggregates that are monotone with respect to set containment. Therefore, these aggregates can be freely used in recursive programs, and the fixpoints for such programs can be computed efficiently using the standard techniques of deductive databases. We describe the many new applications of user-defined aggregates, and their implementation for the logical data language LDL++. Finally, we discuss the transfer of this technology to SQL databases. 1 Introduction
