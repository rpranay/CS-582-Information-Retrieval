Support Vector Machine - Reference Manual this document will describe these programs. To find out more about SVMs, see the bibliography. We will not describe how SVMs work here. The first program we will describe is the paragen program, as it specifies all parameters needed for the SVM. 3 paragen When using the support vector machine for any given task, it is always necessary to specify a set of parameters. These parameters include information such as whether you are interested in pattern recognition or regression estimation, what kernel you are using, what scaling is to be done on the data, etc... paragen generates parameter files used by the SVM program, if no file was generated the user will be asked interactively.
