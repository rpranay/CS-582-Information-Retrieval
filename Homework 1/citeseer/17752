Learning Situation-Specific Control In Multi-Agent Systems   The work presented in this thesis deals with techniques to improve problem solving control skills of cooperative agents through machine learning. In a multi-agent system, the local problem solving control of an agent can interact in complex and intricate ways with the problem solving control of other agents. In such systems, an agent cannot make effective control decisions based purely on its local problem solving state. Effective cooperation requires that the global problem-solving state influence the local control decisions made by an agent. We call such an influence cooperative control. An agent with a purely local view of the problem solving situation cannot learn ...
