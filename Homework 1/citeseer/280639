TIP: A Temporal Extension to Informix Commercial relational database systems today provide only limited temporal support. To address the  needs of applications requiring rich temporal data and queries, we have built TIP (Temporal Information  Processor), a temporal extension to the Informix database system based on its DataBlade technology.  Our TIP DataBlade extends Informix with a rich set of datatypes and routines that facilitate temporal  modeling and querying. TIP provides both C and Java libraries for client applications to access a TIPenabled  database, and provides end-users with a GUI interface for querying and browsing temporal data.  1 Introduction  Our research in temporal data warehouses [9, 10] has led us to require a relational database system with full SQL as well as rich temporal support, in order to experiment with our temporal view-maintenance techniques. Most commercial relational database systems support only a DATE type (or its variants). An attribute of type DATE can be used to timestamp a tuple with...
