Rule Discovery with a Parallel Genetic Algorithm An important issue in data mining is scalability  with respect to the size of the dataset being  mined. In the paper we address this issue by  presenting a parallel GA for rule discovery. This  algorithm exploits both data parallelism, by  distributing the data being mined across all  available processors, and control parallelism, by  distributing the population of individuals across  all available processors.  1
