Time Series Classification by Boosting Interval Based Literals A supervised classification method for temporal series, even multivariate, is presented. It is based on boosting very simple classifiers: clauses with one literal in the body. The background predicates are based on temporal intervals. Two types of predicates are used: i) relative predicates, such as "increases" and "stays", and ii) region predicates, such as "always" and "sometime", which operate over regions in the dominion of the variable. Experiments on di#erent data sets, several of them obtained from the UCI repositories, show that the proposed method is highly competitive with previous approaches.  Keywords: time series classification, interval based literals, boosting, machine learning.  1
