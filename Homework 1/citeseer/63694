Investigating Interactions Between Agent Conversations and Agent Control Components Exploring agent conversation in the context of fine-grained agent coordination research has raised several intellectual questions. The major issues pertain to interactions between different agent conversations, the representations chosen for different classes of conversations, the explicit modeling of interactions between the conversations, and how to address these interactions. This paper is not so ambitious as to attempt to address these questions, only frame them in the context of quantified, scheduling-centric multi-agent coordination. research. 1 Introduction  Based on a long history of work in agents and agent control components for building distributed AI and multi-agent systems, we are attempting to frame and address a set of intellectual questions pertaining to agent conversation. Interaction lies at the heart of the matter; the issue is interaction between different agent conversations, that possibly occur at different levels of abstraction, but also interaction between the m...
