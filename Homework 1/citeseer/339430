The Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes We applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to hyperspectral images in  order to learn an ecient representation of color in natural scenes. In the spectra of  single pixels, the algorithm found basis functions that had broadband spectra, as well  as basis functions that were similar to natural reectance spectra. When applied to  small image patches, the algorithm found basis functions that were achromatic and  others with overall chromatic variation along lines in color space, indicating color  opponency. The directions of opponency were not strictly orthogonal. Comparison  1  with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the basis of statistical measures such as  average mutual information, kurtosis and entropy, shows that the ICA transformation  results in much sparser coecients and gives higher coding eciency. Our ndings  suggest that non-orthogonal opponent encoding of photoreceptor signals leads to  higher coding eciency, and that ICA may be used to reveal the underlying stati...
