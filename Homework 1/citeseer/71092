The Dynamics of Database Views . The dynamics of relational database can be specified by means of Reiter's formalism based on the situation calculus. The specification of transaction based database updates is given in terms of Successor State Axioms (SSAs) for the base tables of the database. These axioms completely describe the contents of the tables at an arbitrary state of the database that is generated by the execution of a legal primitive transaction, and thus solve the frame problem for databases. In this paper we show how to derive action--effect based SSAs for views from the SSAs for the base tables. We prove consistency properties for those axioms. In addition, we establish the relationship between the derived SSA and the view definition as a static integrity constraint of the database. We give applications of the derived SSAs to the problems of view maintenance, and checking, proving, and enforcement of integrity constraints. 1 Introduction  The situation calculus (SC) [MH1] is a family of many sorted lang...
