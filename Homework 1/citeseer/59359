Introducing a Two-Level Grammar Concept for Design (Extended Abstract) this paper.  A few investigation may first illustrate the differences of our new concepts from known hierarchies. Even if L(G) is regular, L(DG) may be not context-free. There is no need for a proof as it is folklore that pattern languages are usually not context-free. We present a few further trivialities to warm up: In case j V j = 1, L(DG) is regular if and only if L(G) is regular. If T 1 and T 2 are disjoint, it holds: 1. Membership for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. 2. Emptyness for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. 3. Finiteness for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. There is no need for an explicit proof. The results above are immediately inherited from classical results in formal language theory (cf. [HU79]). Further properties seem to require particular assumptions. For the intended application domain, languages which satisfy T 1 n T 2 6= ; are of a particular importance. It may also be of a special interest to consider languages with a certain rate of letters from T 1 n T 2 in terminal words. 3.2 Graph Grammars
