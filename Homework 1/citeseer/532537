Self-Organization in Multiagent Systems: From Agent Interaction to Agent Organization In this paper we suggest a new sociological concept to the study of (self-)  organization in multiagent systems. First, we discuss concepts of (self-) organization  typically used in DAI. From a sociological point of view all these concepts are missing  the special quality of organizations as self-organizing social entities. Therefore we  present a concept of organization based on the habitus-field theory of Pierre Bourdieu.
