Using Augmented Reality to Visualise Architecture Designs in an Outdoor Environment This paper presents the use of a wearable computer system to visualise outdoor architectural features using augmented reality. The paper examines the question -  How does one visualise a design for a building, modification to a building, or extension to an existing building relative to its physical surroundings?  The solution presented to this problem is to use a mobile augmented reality platform to visualise the design in spatial context of its final physical surroundings. The paper describes the mobile augmented reality platform TINMITH2 used in the investigation. The operation of the system is described through a detailed example of the system in operation. The system was used to visualise a simple extension to a building on one of the University of South Australia campuses.
