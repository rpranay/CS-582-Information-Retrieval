The 3W Model and Algebra for Unified Data Mining Real data mining/analysis applications call for a  framework which adequately supports knowledge  discovery as a multi-step process, where the input  of one mining operation can be the output of another.  Previous studies, primarily focusing on fast  computation of one specific mining task at a time,  ignore this vital issue.  Motivated by this observation, we develop a unified  model supporting all major mining and analysis  tasks. Our model consists of three distinct  worlds, corresponding to intensional and extensional  dimensions, and to data sets. The notion of  dimension is a centerpiece of the model. Equipped  with hierarchies, dimensions integrate the output  of seemingly dissimilar mining and analysis operations  in a clean manner.  We propose an algebra, called the dimension algebra,  for manipulating (intensional) dimensions,  as well as operators that serve as "bridges" between  the worlds. We demonstrate by examples  that several real data mining processes can be captured ...
