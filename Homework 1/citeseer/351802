Design and Implementation of the OLOG Deductive Object-Oriented Database Management System . OLOG is a novel deductive database system for advanced  intelligent information system applications. It directly supports eective  storage, ecient access and inference of large amount of persistent data  with complex structures. It provides a SQL-like data denition language  and data manipulation language, and a declarative rule-based query language.  It combines the best of the deductive, object-oriented, and objectrelational  approaches in a uniform framework. This paper describes the  design and implementation of the OLOG system.  1 Introduction  Deductive, object-oriented, and object-relational databases are three important extensions of the traditional relational database technology. Deductive databases stem from the integration of logic programming and relational databases. It oers representational and operational uniformity, reasoning capabilities, recursion, declarative querying, ecient secondary storage access, etc. However, deductive databases based on relational databas...
