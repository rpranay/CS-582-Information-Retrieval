Principles for a Usability-Oriented Pattern Language High-level usability principles (e.g. "Familiarity") are difficult to apply to specific projects, and style guides providing more detailed instructions are often misinterpreted and inaccessible. An approach to usability based on design patterns enables designers to learn how certain recurring problems can be solved according to high-level principles.

A sample pattern which exemplifies this philosophy, involving iteration through selectable objects, is described. KEYWORDS Usability engineering, Design techniques, Style guides.  1.

One of the primary ways to smoothly integrate the disciplines ...
