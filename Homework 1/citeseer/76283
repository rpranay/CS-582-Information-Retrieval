A Parametric Alternative to Grids for Occupancy-Based World Modeling In the paper, we consider an occupancy-based approach for range data fusion, as it is used in mobile robotics. We tackle the major problem of this approach, which is the redundancy of stored and processed data caused by using the grid representation of the occupancy function, by proposing a parametric piece-wise linear representation. When applied to the vision-based world exploration, the new representation is shown to have advantages over the former one, which include its suitability for radial range data, its efficiency in representing and fusing range data, and its convenience for navigation map extraction. The proposed technique is implemented on a mobile robot, Boticelli. The results obtained from running the robot are presented. 1 Introduction  In mobile robot world exploration, the occupancybased  approach is one of the most commonly used [7, 13, 3, 2, 8, 4, 11]. In this approach, the exploration policy is determined by the occupancy model of the world which is built from the r...
