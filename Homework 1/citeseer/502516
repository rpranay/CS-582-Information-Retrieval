Storing and Querying Multiversion XML Documents using Durable Node Numbers Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents an important problem for many traditional applications, such as software configuration control, as well as new ones, such as link permanence of web documents. Research on managing multiversion XML documents seeks to provide efficient and robust techniques for storing, retrieving and querying such documents. In this paper, we present a novel approach to version management that achieves these objectives by a scheme based on Durable Node Numbers and timestamps for the elements of XML documents. We first present efficient storage and retrieval techniques for multiversion documents. Then, we explore the indexing and clustering strategies needed to assure efficient support for complex queries on content and on document evolution.
