Maximizing Coverage of Mediated Web Queries Over the Web, mediators are built on large collections of sources to provide integrated access  to Web content (e.g., meta-search engines). In order to minimize the expense of visiting a large  number of sources, mediators need to choose a subset of sources to contact when processing  queries. As fewer sources participate in processing a mediated query, the coverage of the query  goes down. In this paper, we study this trade-off and develop techniques for mediators to  maximize the coverage for their queries while at the same time visiting a subset of their sources.  We formalize the problem; study its complexity; propose algorithms to solve it; and analyze the  theoretical performance guarantees of the algorithms. We also study the performance of our  algorithms through simulation experiments.  1 Introduction  Web sources often provide limited information "coverage." For instance, one type of information source is search engines, such as Lycos [27], Northern Light [29] and Yahoo [30]....
