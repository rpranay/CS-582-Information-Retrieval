First-Order Queries On Finite Structures Over The Reals We investigate properties of finite relational structures over the  reals expressed by first-order sentences whose predicates are the relations  of the structure plus arbitrary polynomial inequalities, and  whose quantifiers can range over the whole set of reals. In constraint  programming terminology, this corresponds to Boolean real polynomial  constraint queries on finite structures. The fact that quantifiers  range over all reals seems crucial; however, we observe that each sentence  in the first-order theory of the reals can be evaluated by letting  each quantifier range over only a finite set of real numbers without  changing its truth value. Inspired by this observation, we then show  that when all polynomials used are linear, each query can be expressed  uniformly on all finite structures by a sentence of which the quantifiers  range only over the finite domain of the structure. In other words,  linear constraint programming on finite structures can be reduced to  ordinary query evaluation as usual in finite model theory and databases.  Moreover, if only "generic" queries are taken into consideration,  we show that this can be reduced even further by proving that such  Dept.
