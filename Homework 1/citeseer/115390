Aspects of Interface Agents: Avatar, Assistant and Actor This paper introduces the interface agent research project being carryied out at ATR Media Integration & Communications Research Labs. We are interested in virtual interface agents to support human creative activities by mediating between human users and computer cyberspace. In this paper, we categorize interface agents into three types; avatars, assistants and actors based on their functionality and discuss a design framework of agents and related applications. We present the current status and objectives for the following topics; design of an asynchronous-hierarchical agent architecture, a character locomotion design tool, applications in a virtualized museum and a group discussion environment in which virtual agents would inhabit and act.  1 Introduction  A "virtual interface agent," or interface agent, is defined in this paper as an autonomous agent which mediates between a human user and computer cyberspace. An interface agent differs from an ordinary interface since it is expecte...
