Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn  envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed in [22] as a form of "knowledge compilation,  " supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is  static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out  in [17]. On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature  for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments,  even in the Horn case, as was pointed out in [6], and is further demonstrated in the present  paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a  single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn  structure, etc.). In this paper  1  we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which  combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very  efficient, free of...
