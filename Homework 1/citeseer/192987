Image Retrieval: Past, Present, And Future This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the technical achievements in the research area of Image Retrieval, especially Content-Based Image Retrieval, an area so active and prosperous in the past few years. The survey includes 100+ papers covering the research aspects of image feature representation and extraction, multi-dimensional indexing, and system design, three of the fundamental bases of Content-Based Image Retrieval. Furthermore, based on the state-of-the-art technology available now and the demand from real-world applications, open research issues are identified, and future promising research directions are suggested. 1.
