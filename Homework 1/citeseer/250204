Communicating Agents We study the problem of endowing logic-based agents that can reason about their own beliefs as well as the beliefs of other agents with communication skills. We show how communication performatives from existing agent communication languages as well as their preconditions and eects can be expressed within logic-based agents in terms of the agents' beliefs. We illustrate the resulting language for programming logic-based agents by means of examples. 1 Introduction  In an earlier paper [6], we propose an approach to logic-based agents by combining the approach to agents by Kowalski and Sadri [11] and the approach to meta-reasoning by Costantini et al. [5, 4]. Similarly to Kowalski and Sadri's agents, the agents in [6] are hybrid in that they exhibit both rational  (or deliberative) and reactive behaviour. The reasoning core of the agents is a proof procedure that combines forward and backward reasoning. Backward reasoning is used primarily for planning, problem solving and other deliber...
