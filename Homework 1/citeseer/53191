Layered Learning This paper presents layered learning, a hierarchical  machine learning paradigm. Layered  learning applies to tasks for which learning  a direct mapping from inputs to outputs  is intractable with existing learning algorithms.  Given a hierarchical task decomposition  into subtasks, layered learning seamlessly  integrates separate learning at each  subtask layer. The learning of each subtask  directly facilitates the learning of the next  higher subtask layer by determining at least  one of three of its components: (i) the set of  training examples; (ii) the input representation;  and/or (iii) the output representation.  We introduce layered learning in its domainindependent  general form. We then present  a full implementation in a complex domain,  namely simulated robotic soccer.  1. Introduction  Machine learning (ML) algorithms select a hypothesis from a hypothesis space based on a set of training examples such that the chosen hypothesis is predicted to characterize unseen examples...
