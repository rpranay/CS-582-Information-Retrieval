An Architecture for Mobile BDI Agents BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) is a mature and commonly adopted architecture for Intelligent Agents. BDI Agents are autonomous entities able to work in teams and react to changing environmental conditions. However, the current computational model adopted by BDI has problems which, amongst other limitations, prevent the development of mobile agents. In this paper, we discuss an architecture,  TOMAS (Transaction Oriented Multi Agent System), that addresses these issues by combining BDI and the distributed nested transaction paradigms. An algorithm is presented which enable agents in TOMAS to become mobile.  1 Introduction  Intelligent Agents are a very active area of AI research [WJ95] [Sho93]. Of the various agent architectures which have been proposed, BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) [RG92] is probably the most mature and has been adopted by a few industrial applications. BDI Agents are autonomous entities able to work in teams and react to changing environmental conditions. Mobile m...
