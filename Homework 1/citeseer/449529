An Agent-Based Framework for Financial Transactions Ever-changing Internet technologies are creating revolutions in the way people interact with each other. In particular, business interactions are rapidly transforming and evolving toward more dynamic and automated solutions. Among various on-line commercial activities, financial services represent a fundamental component for developing and supplying many other e-businesses. The main idea behind efinance  is to provide support by deploying software instruments that enable to automate many of B2B and B2C transactions. The current degree of automation and personalisation of on-line financial services is still very limited: Web interfaces or ad hoc tools still require a lots of human interactions. Agent technology seems to be one of the most promising approaches for evolving toward more flexible and dynamic solutions. Autonomous, intelligent, social and selfinterested software entities would act on behalf of final endusers and/or business operators without the need for direct human involvement. This paper describes an agent-based system supporting automated business transactions. The aim is to evaluate the main potential and the major limits of supplying financial services by deploying agents in a software environment.  Keywords  agent-based interactions, e-finance, electronic payments, ontology. 1.
