Case-Based Classification Using Similarity-Based Retrieval Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is based on a notion of similarity assessment and was developed for supporting flexible retrieval of relevant information. Validity of the proposed approach is tested on real world domains, and the system's performance is compared to that of other machine learning algorithms. 1 Introduction  Classification involves associating instances with particular classes; based on the object description, the classification system determines whether a given object belongs to a specified class. In general, this process consists of: first generating a set of categories and then classifying given objects into the created categories. For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories are known a priori from a prescribed domain theory [38]. Various reasoning tech...
