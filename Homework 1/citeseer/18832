XM2VTSDB: The Extended M2VTS Database In this paper we describe the acquisition and content of a large multi-modal database intended for training and testing of multi-modal verification systems. The XM2VTSDB database offers synchronised video and speech data as well as image sequences allowing multiple views of the face. It consists of digital video recordings taken of 295 hundred subjects at one month intervals taken over a period of five months. We also describe a protocol for evaluating verification algorithms on the database. The database has been made available to anyone on request to the University of Surrey through http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Research/VSSP/xm2vtsdb.
