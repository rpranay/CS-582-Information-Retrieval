Imitation and Mechanisms of Joint Attention: A Developmental Structure for Building Social Skills on a Humanoid Robot Abstract. Adults are extremely adept at recognizing social cues, such as eye direction or pointing gestures, that establish the basis of joint attention. These skills serve as the developmental basis for more complex forms of metaphor and analogy by allowing an infant to ground shared experiences and by assisting in the development of more complex communication skills. In this chapter, we review some of the evidence for the developmental course of these joint attention skills from developmental psychology, from disorders of social development such as autism, and from the evolutionary development of these social skills. We also describe an on-going research program aimed at testing existing models of joint attention development by building a human-like robot which communicates naturally with humans using joint attention. Our group has constructed an upper-torso humanoid robot, called Cog, in part to investigate how to build intelligent robotic systems by following a developmental progression of skills similar to that observed in human development. Just as a child learns social skills and conventions through interactions with its parents, our robot will learn to interact with people using natural social communication. We further consider the critical role that imitation plays in bootstrapping a system from simple visual behaviors to more complex social skills. We will present data from a face and eye finding system that serves as the basis of this developmental chain, and an example of how this system can imitate the head movements of an individual. 1
