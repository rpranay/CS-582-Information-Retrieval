Secure Object Spaces - A coordination model for Agents Coordination languages based on shared data spaces are well suited to programming parallel applications composed of cooperating software components. Secure Object Spaces (SOS) extend this model to support composition of independently developed, mutually suspicious, software components. SOS provides flexible and efficient security facilities based on a cryptographic re-interpretation of object types. We discuss the implementation of secure object spaces in the context of a Java-based mobile agent system. 1 Introduction  Coordination languages based on shared data spaces have been around for over fifteen years. Oftentimes, researchers have advocated their use for structuring distributed and concurrent systems. This because the mode of communication provided by these languages, sometimes called generative communication, is  anonymous --- processes interact by reading and writing entries in a shared space without having to know their interlocutor(s); and is uncoupled --- processes are not ...
