Logic-based Genetic Programming with Definite Clause Translation Grammars DCTG-GP is a genetic programming system that uses definite clause translation grammars. A DCTG is a logical version of an attribute grammar that supports the definition of context--free languages, and it allows semantic information associated with a language to be easily accomodated by the grammar. This is useful in genetic programming for defining the interpreter of a target language, or incorporating both syntactic and semantic problem--specific contraints into the evolutionary search. The DCTG-GP system improves on other grammar--based GP systems by permitting non--trivial semantic aspects of the language to be defined with the grammar. It also automatically analyzes grammar rules in order to determine their minimal depth and termination characteristics, which are required when generating random program trees of varied shapes and sizes. An application using DCTG-GP is described. 1 INTRODUCTION  Genetic programming (GP) implementations have benefitted from simple program denotations....
