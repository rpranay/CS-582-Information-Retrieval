Centroid-Based Document Classification: Analysis & Experimental Results . In this paper we present a simple linear-time centroid-based document  classification algorithm, that despite its simplicity and robust performance,  has not been extensively studied and analyzed. Our experiments show that this  centroid-based classifier consistently and substantially outperforms other algorithms  such as Naive Bayesian, k-nearest-neighbors, and C4.5, on a wide range  of datasets. Our analysis shows that the similarity measure used by the centroidbased  scheme allows it to classify a new document based on how closely its behavior  matches the behavior of the documents belonging to different classes. This  matching allows it to dynamically adjust for classes with different densities and  accounts for dependencies between the terms in the different classes.  1 Introduction  We have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of online text documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, news sources, and company-wide intranets. It has been forecasted that these docu...
