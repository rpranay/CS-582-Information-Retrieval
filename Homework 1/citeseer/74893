Identifying Distinctive Subsequences in Multivariate Time Series by Clustering Most time series comparison algorithms attempt to discover what the members of a set of time series have in common. We investigate a different problem, determining what distinguishes time series in that set from other time series obtained from the same source. In both cases the goal is to identify shared patterns, though in the latter case those patterns must be distinctive as well. An efficient incremental algorithm for identifying distinctive subsequences in multivariate, real-valued time series is described and evaluated with data from two very different sources: the response of a set of bandpass filters to human speech and the sensors of a mobile robot.  1 Introduction  Given two or more sequences of discrete tokens, a dynamic programming algorithm exists for finding the longest common subsequence they share (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest 1990). This basic algorithm has been adapted in various ways to find patterns shared by real-valued time series as well (Kruskall & Sankoff 1983). ...
