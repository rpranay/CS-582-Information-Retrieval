Experiments on Automatic Web Page Categorization for IR system This paper describes keyword-based Web page categorization. Our goal is to embed our categorization technique into information retrieval (IR) systems to facilitate the end-users' search task. In such systems, search results must be categorized faster, while keeping accuracy high. Our categorization system uses a knowledge base (KB) to assign categories to Web pages. The KB contains a set of characteristic keywords with weights by category, and is automatically generated from training texts. With the keyword-based approach, the algorithms to extract keywords and assign weights to them should be considered, because the algorithms affect strongly both categorization accuracy and processing speed. Furthermore, we must take two characteristics of Web pages into account: (1) the text length is very variable, which makes it harder to use statistics such as word frequency to calculate keyword weights, and (2) a huge number of distinct words are used, which makes the KB bigger and therefore pro...
