ROL2: A Real Deductive Object-Oriented Database Language . ROL is a strongly typed deductive object-oriented database  language. It integrates many important features of deductive databases  and object-oriented databases. However, it is only a structurally objectoriented  language. In this paper, we describe our extension of ROL called  ROL2. ROL2 keeps all the important features of ROL. In addition, it incorporates  important behaviorally object-oriented features such as rulebased  methods and encapsulation so that it is a real deductive objectoriented  database language. It supports object identity, complex objects,  class hierarchy, methods, non-monotonic multiple structural and behavioral  inheritance with overriding and blocking.  1 Introduction  In the past decade, a number of deductive object-oriented database languages have been proposed, such as O-logic [21], revised O-logic [15], IQL [1], LOGRES [7], Datalog  meth  [2], CORAL++[26], Gulog [10], Rock & Roll [3] Flogic [14], and ROL [18, 19]. However, most of them are only structural...
