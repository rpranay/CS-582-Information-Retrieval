ITTALKS: A Case Study in the Semantic Web and DAML . Effective use of the vast quantity of information now available on the web  will require the use of "Semantic Web" markup languages such as the DARPA Agent  Markup Language (DAML). Such languages will enable the automated gathering and  processing of much information that is currently available but insufficiently utilized.  Effectively, such languages will facilitate the integration of multi-agent systems with  the existing information infrastructure. As part of our exploration of Semantic Web  technology, and DAML in particular, we have constructed ITTALKS, a web-based  system for automatic and intelligent notification of information technology talks. In  this paper, we describe the ITTALKS system, and discuss the numerous ways in which  the use of Semantic Web concepts and DAML extend its ability to provide an intelligent  online service to both the human community and the agents assisting them.  1
