Towards Adaptive Fault Tolerance For Distributed Multi-Agent Systems This paper studies how to bring flexibility to fault-tolerant systems. Firstly, multi-agent systems are identified as a very valuable basis for reaching this goal, and reliability is also shown to be a rare and attractive feature for such systems. We then propose a framework for building applications that provide adaptive fault tolerance, and put forward the promising results obtained when testing the implementation of this framework. We conclude with drawing some perspectives of evolution of our work.
