Inferring Web Communities Through Relaxed Cocitation and Dense Bipartite Graphs Community forming is one of the important activity in the Web. The Web harbors a large number of communities. A community is a group of content creators that manifests itself as a set of interlinked pages. Given a large collection of pages our aim is to find potential communities in the Web. In the literature, Ravi Kumar et al. [18] proposed a trawling method to find potential communities by abstracting a core of the community as a group of pages that form a complete bipartite graph (CBG) (web-page as a node and link as an edge between two nodes). The trawling approach extracts a small group of pages that form a CBG, which is a signature of a potential community.
