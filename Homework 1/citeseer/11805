Placing a Robot Manipulator Amid Obstacles for Optimized Execution This paper presents an efficient algorithm for optimizing the base location of a robot manipulator in an environment cluttered with obstacles, in order to execute specified tasks as fast as possible. The algorithm uses randomized motion planning techniques and exploits geometric "coherence " in configuration space to achieve fast computation. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on both synthetic examples and real-life CAD data from the automotive industry. The computation time ranges from under a minute for simple problems to a few minutes for more complex ones. 1 Introduction The base placement of a robot manipulator is an important issue in many robotics applications. Given a description of a robot manipulator and its environment, the goal is to find a base location for the manipulator so that specified tasks are executed as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm that makes use of randomized motion planning techniques to compute simultaneously ...
