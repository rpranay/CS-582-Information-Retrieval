Solving Stabilization Problems in Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition Case-based reasoning is widely deemed an important methodology towards alleviating the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition. The key idea is to collect cases representing a human's or a system's experience directly rather than trying to construct generalizations. Episodic knowledge accumulated this way may be used flexibly for different purposes by determining similarities between formerly solved problems and current situations under investigation. But the flexibility of case-based reasoning brings with it a number of disadvantages. One crucial difficulty is that every new experience might seem worth to be memorized. As a result, a case-based reasoning system may substantially suffer from collecting a huge amount of garbage without being able to separate the chaff from the wheat. This paper presents a case study in case-based learning. Some target concept has to be learned by collecting cases and tuning similarity concepts. It is extremely difficult to avoid collecting a huge amount of ...
