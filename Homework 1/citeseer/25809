Object-relational Queries into Multidimensional Databases with the Active Data Repository As computational power and storage capacity increase, processing and analyzing large volumes  of multi-dimensional datasets play an increasingly important role in many domains of scientific research. Scientific applications that make use of very large scientific datasets have several  important characteristics: datasets consist of complex data and are usually multi-dimensional;  applications usually retrieve a subset of all the data available in the dataset; various application-specific operations are performed on the data items retrieved. Such applications can be supported  by object-relational database management systems (OR-DBMSs). In addition to providing  functionality to define new complex datatypes and user-defined functions, an OR-DBMS  for scientific datasets should contain runtime support that will provide optimized storage for  very large datasets and an execution environment for user-defined functions involving expensive  operations. In this paper we describe an infrastructure, t...
