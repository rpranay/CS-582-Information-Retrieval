A Multi-Agent Reflective Architecture for Web Search Assistance Nowadays the Web is overloaded with documents and even finding out  whether some of the items selected by search engines are worth reading is a tedious  and time consuming job. This paper proposes a general framework and specific assistant  agents that are used to enrich browsers with the ability to characterise the user interests  and to influence results of search engines according to such interests. To enrich  Web browsers, a reflective architecture was used that captures control from browser  objects at run time and intertwines further activities when some conditions are verified.
