Ephemeral and Persistent Personalization in Adaptive Information Access to Scholarly Publications on the Web We show how personalization techniques can be exploited to  implement more adaptive and effective information access systems in  electronic publishing. We distinguish persistent (or long term) and  ephemeral (or short term) personalization, and we describe how both of  them can be profitably applied in information filtering and retrieval systems  used, via a specialized Web portal, by physicists in their daily job. By means  of several experimental results, we demonstrate that persistent  personalization is needed and useful for information filtering systems, and  ephemeral personalization leads to more effective and usable information  retrieval systems.
