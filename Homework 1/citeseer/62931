From theory to practice: The UTEP robot in the AAAI 96 and AAAI 97 robot contests In this paper we describe the control aspects of Diablo, the UTEP mobile robot participant in two AAAI robot competitions. In the first competition, event one of the AAAI 96 robot contest, Diablo consistently scored 285  1  out of a total of 295 points. In the second competition, our robot won the first place in the event "Tidy Up" of the home vacuum contest. The main goal in this paper will be to show how the agent theories - based on action theories -- developed at UTEP and by Saffiotti et al. was used in the building of Diablo.  1 Introduction  We participated  2  in the AAAI 96 robot navigation contest [KNH97] and the AAAI 97 home vacuum contest. In the first competition, our team scored 285 points in all runs of the contest out of a total of 295 points and was placed third in the finals. In the second competition, we won the first place in the event "Tidy Up." In this paper we relate theory of agents, particularly the one developed at UTEP, for higher level control, and the one by...
