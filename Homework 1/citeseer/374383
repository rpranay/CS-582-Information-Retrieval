Localisation using Automatically Selected Landmarks from Panoramic Images The use of visual landmarks for robot localisation is a promising field. It is apparent that the success of localisation by visual landmarks depends on the landmarks chosen. Good landmarks are those which remain reliable over time and through changes in position and orientation. This paper describes a system which learns places by automatically selecting landmarks from panoramic images and uses them for localisation tasks. An adaption of the biologically inspired Turn Back and Look behaviour is used to evaluate potential landmarks. Normalised correlation is used to overcome the a#ects of changes in illumination in the environment. Results from real robot experiments are reported, showing successful localisation from up to one meter away from the learnt position. 1 Introduction Visual localisation is one of the key problems in making successful autonomous robots. Vision as a sensor is the richest source of information about a mobile agent's environment and as such con...
