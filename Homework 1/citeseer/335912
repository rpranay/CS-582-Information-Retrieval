OBDD-based Universal Planning for Synchronized Agents in Non-Deterministic Domains Recently model checking representation and search techniques were shown to be efficiently  applicable to planning, in particular to non-deterministic planning. Such planning  approaches use Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (obdds) to encode a planning  domain as a non-deterministic finite automaton and then apply fast algorithms from model  checking to search for a solution. obdds can effectively scale and can provide universal  plans for complex planning domains. We are particularly interested in addressing the  complexities arising in non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. In this article, we present  umop, a new universal obdd-based planning framework for non-deterministic, multi-agent  domains. We introduce a new planning domain description language, NADL, to specify  non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. The language contributes the explicit definition  of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents. We describe the syntax and  semantics of NADL and show how to bu...
