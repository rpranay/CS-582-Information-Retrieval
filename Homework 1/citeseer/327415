How Developmental Psychology and Robotics Complement Each Other This paper presents two complementary ideas relating  the study of human development and the  construction of intelligent artifacts. First, the use  of developmental models will be a critical requirement  in the construction of robotic systems that  can acquire a large repertoire of motor, perceptual,  and cognitive capabilities. Second, robotic  systems can be used as a test-bed for evaluating  models of human development much in the same  way that simulation studies are currently used  to evaluate cognitive models. To further explore  these ideas, two examples from the author's own  work will be presented: the use of developmental  models of hand-eye coordination to simplify the  task of learning to reach for a visual target and  the use of a humanoid robot to evaluate models  of normal and abnormal social skill development.  Introduction  Research on human development and research on the construction of intelligent artifacts can and should be complementary. Studies of human developm...
