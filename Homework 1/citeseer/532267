A Comparison of Decision Making Criteria and Optimization Methods for Active Robotic Sensing This work presents a comparison of decision making criteria  and optimization methods for active sensing in robotics. Active sensing  incorporates the following aspects: (i) where to position sensors, and  (ii) how to make decisions for next actions, in order to maximize information  gain and minimize costs. We concentrate on the second aspect:  "Where should the robot move at the next time step?". Pros and cons of  the most often used statistical decision making strategies are discussed.
