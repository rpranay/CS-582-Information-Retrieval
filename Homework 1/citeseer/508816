Enabling Ad-Hoc Collaboration through Schedule Learning and Prediction The transferal of the desktop interface to the world at large is not the goal of ubiquitous computing. Rather, ubiquitous computing strives to increase the responsiveness of the world at large to the individual. A large part of this responsiveness is improved communication with other individuals. In this paper we describe a system that can enable ad--hoc collaboration between several people by creating a model of the daily schedules of individuals and by performing predictions based on this model. Using GPS data we learn to distinguish locations and track the times that these locations are visited. In addition, we use Markov models to predict which locations might be visited next based on the user's previous behavior.
