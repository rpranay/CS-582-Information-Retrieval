Curio: A Novel Solution for Efficient Storage and Indexing in Data Warehouses Efficient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems as decision support applications often require interactive response times to answer complex, ad-hoc queries (e.g., aggregations, multi-way joins) over vast repositories of data (e.g., hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size). The most common approach used to improve On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) query performance is to utilize indexes or access structures to quickly access the base data. A major drawback to this approach is that it often incurs significant overhead as the access structures must be stored in addition to the base data. In this paper, we present Curio, a data repository and OLAP query server, which provides drastically improved performance for ad-hoc queries, while simultaneously reducing the storage costs associated with warehousing. Curio, a data storage and access technology for data warehouses recently developed by Muninn Technologies, LLC, is based on a novel paradigm that all...
