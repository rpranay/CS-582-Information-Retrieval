Agent Aided Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance is performed bymechanics who are required,  for non-standard discrepancies, to consult expert engineers for repair  instructions and approval. In addition to their own experience, these  engineers rely on external information sources, which are often inadequately  indexed and geographically dispersed. The timely retrieval  of this distributed information is essencial to the engineers' abilityto  devise and recommend repair procedures in response to the mechanics  ' requests. This problem domain is well suited for a multi-agent  system: it consists of distributed multi-modal information whichis  needed bymultiple users with diverse preferences. In this paper, we  describe an implementation of such a system, using the RETSINA  multi-agentarchitecture. Such an implementation reinforces the importance  of multi-agent systems, and in particular the usefulness of  the RETSINA infrastructure as a basis for the construction of such  systems.  i  1 Introduction  Agent aided...
