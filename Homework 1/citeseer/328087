Incremental Document Clustering for Web Page Classification Motivated by the benefits in organizing the documents in Web search engines, we  consider the problem of automatic Web page classification. We employ the clustering  techniques. Each document is represented by a feature vector. By analyzing the  clusters formed by these vectors, we can assign the documents within the same  cluster to the same class automatically. Our contributions are the following: (1)  We propose a feature extraction mechanism which is more suitable to Web page  classification. (2) We introduce a tree structure called the DC-tree to make the  clustering process incremental and less sensitive to the document insertion order.  (3) We show with experiments on a set of Internet documents from Yahoo! that the  proposed clustering algorithm can classify Web pages effectively.
