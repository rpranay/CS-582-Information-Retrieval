Employing EM and Pool-Based Active Learning for Text Classification This paper shows how a text classifier's need for labeled training data can be reduced by a combination of active learning and Expectation Maximization (EM) on a pool of unlabeled data. Query-by-Committee is used to actively select documents for labeling, then EM with a naive Bayes model further improves classification accuracy by concurrently estimating probabilistic labels for the remaining unlabeled documents and using them to improve the model. We also present a metric for better measuring disagreement among committee members; it accounts for the strength of their disagreement and for the distribution of the documents. Experimental results show that our method of combining EM and active learning requires only half as many labeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either EM or active learning alone.
