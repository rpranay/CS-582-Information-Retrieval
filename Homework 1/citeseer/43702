Autonomous Learning of Sequential Tasks: Experiments and Analyses : This paper presents a novel learning model Clarion, which is a hybrid model based on the twolevel approach proposed in Sun (1995). The model integrates neural, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line, bottom-up learning (i.e., learning that goes from neural to symbolic representations). The model utilizes both procedural and declarative knowledge (in neural and symbolic representations respectively), tapping into the synergy of the two types of processes. It was applied to deal with sequential decision tasks. Experiments and analyses in various ways are reported that shed light on the advantages of the model.  obstacles agent target Figure 1: Navigating Through A Minefield  1 Introduction  This paper presents a model that unifies neural, symbolic, and reinforcement learning. It addresses the following three issues: (1) It deals with autonomous learning: It allows a situated agent to learn autonomously and continuously, from on-going experience in the world, w...
