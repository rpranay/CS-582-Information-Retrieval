Creatures: Entertainment Software Agents with Artificial Life We present a technical description of Creatures, a commercial home-entertainment software package. Creatures provides a simulatedenvironment in which exist a number of synthetic agents that a user can interact with in real-time. The agents (known as "creatures") are intended as sophisticated "virtual pets". The internal architecture of the creatures is strongly inspired by animal biology. Each creature has a neural network responsible for sensory-motorcoordinationand behavior selection, and an "artificial biochemistry" that models a simple energy metabolism along with a "hormonal" system that interacts with the neural network to model diffuse modulation of neuronal activity and staged ontogenetic development. A biologically inspired learning mechanism allows the neural network to adapt during the lifetime of a creature. Learning includes the ability to acquire a simple verb--object language.
