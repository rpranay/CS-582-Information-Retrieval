Execution Monitoring of High-Level Robot Programs. Imagine a robot that is executing a program  on-line, and, insofar as it is reasonable to do  so, it wishes to continue with this on-line  program execution, no matter what exogenous  events occur in the world. Execution  monitoring is the robot's process of observing  the world for discrepancies between the  actual world and its internal representation  of it, and recovering from such discrepancies.  We provide a situation calculus-based account  of such on-line program executions,  with monitoring. This account relies on a  specification for a single-step interpreter for  the logic programming language Golog . The  theory is supported by an implementation  that is illustrated by a standard blocks world  in which a robot is executing a Golog program  to build a suitable tower. The monitor  makes use of a simple kind of planner for  recovering from malicious exogenous actions  performed by another agent. After performing  the sequence of actions generated by the  recovery procedure, th...
