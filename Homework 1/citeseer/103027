Modeling Emotions and Other Motivations in Synthetic Agents We present Cathexis, a distributed, computational model which offers an alternative approach to model the dynamic nature of different affective phenomena, such as emotions, moods and temperaments, and provides a flexible way of modeling their influence on the behavior of synthetic autonomous agents. The model has been implemented as part of an extensible, object-oriented framework which provides enough functionality for agent developers to design emotional agents that can be used in a variety of applications including entertainment (e.g. synthetic agents for interactive drama, video games, etc.), education (e.g. Intelligent Tutoring Systems), and human-computer interfaces.  Introduction  Emotions are an essential part of our lives, they influence how we think and behave, and how we communicate with others. Several researchers have acknowledged their importance in human thinking [Minsky 1986; Toda 1993], and recent neurological evidence seems to support these ideas [LeDoux 1996; Damasio...
