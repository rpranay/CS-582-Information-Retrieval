Fine-Granularity Signature Caching in Object Database Systems In many of the emerging application areas for database systems, data is viewed as a collection  of objects, the access pattern is navigational, and a large fraction of the accesses are perfect match  accesses/queries on one or more words in text strings in the objects in these databases. A typical  example of such an application area is XML/Web storage. In order to reduce the object access  cost, signature files can be used. However, traditional signature file maintenance is costly, and to  be beneficial, a low update rate and high query selectivity is needed to make the maintenance and  use of signatures beneficial. In this report, we present the SigCache approach. Instead of storing  the signatures in separate signature files, the signatures are stored together with their objects. In  addition, the most frequently accessed signatures are stored in a main memory signature cache  (SigCache). Because the signatures are much smaller than the objects, the increase in update cost  is not s...
