Using Guidelines to Constrain Interactive Case-Based HTN Planning This paper describes HICAP, a general purpose and interactive case-based planning architecture. HICAP is a decision support tool for planning a hierarchical course of action. It integrates a hierarchical task editor, HTE, with a conversational case-based planner, NaCoDAE/HTN. HTE maintains a task hierarchy representing guidelines that constrain the final plan. HTE also encodes the hierarchical organization responsible for these tasks. This supports bookkeeping, which is crucial for real-world large-scale planning tasks. HTE can be used to activate NaCoDAE/HTN to interactively refine user-selected guideline tasks into a concrete plan. Our application of HICAP to the task of noncombatant evacuation operations inspired its architecture. In this application, our empirical evaluation with ModSAF simulations confirms that the plans output by HICAP outperform those generated using alternative approaches on three dimensions.
