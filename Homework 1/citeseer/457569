Schema Evolution in Heterogeneous Database Architectures, A Schema Transformation Approach In previous work we have a developed general framework to support schema transformation and integration in heterogeneous database architectures. The framework consists of a hypergraph-based common data model and a set of primitive schema transformations defined for this model. Higher-level common data models and primitive schema transformations for them can be defined in terms of this lower-level model. A key feature of the framework is that both primitive and composite schema transformations are automatically reversible. We have shown in earlier work how this allows automatic query translation from a global schema to a set of source schemas. In this paper we show how our framework also readily supports  evolution of source schemas, allowing the global schema and the query translation pathways to be easily repaired, as opposed to having to be regenerated, after changes to source schemas. 1
