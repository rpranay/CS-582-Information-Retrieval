Querying the Physical World Data Type (ADT) objects that are single attribute values encapsulating a collection of related data [S98]. Note that there are natural parallels between devices and ADTs. Both ADTs and devices provide controlled access to encapsulated data through a well-defined interface. We build upon this observation by modeling each type of device in the network as an ADT. The public interface of the ADT corresponds to the specific functions supported by the device. An actual ADT object in the database corresponds to a physical device in the real world.  Let us model the database schema corresponding to the flood detection example from the  introduction. We consider a simplified schema that consists of the following relations  . RFSensors(Sensor, X, Y)  . Areas (Name, X1, Y1, X2, Y2)  A record in the RFSensors relation has three attributes. The first attribute, called Sensor, is an ADT  that represents the physical rainfall sensor. The actual Sensor data is located on the rainfall sensor;  the ADT ...
