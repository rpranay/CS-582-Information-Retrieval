Towards A Semantic Framework For Service Description The rapid development of the Internet and of distributed computing has led to a proliferation of online service providers such as digital libraries, web information sources, electronically requestable traditional services, and even software-to-software services such as those provided by persistence and event managers. This has created a need for catalogs of services, based on description languages covering both traditional and electronic services. This paper presents a classification and a domainindependent characterisation of services, which provide a foundation for their description to potential consumers. For each of the service characteristics that we consider, we identify the range of its possible values in di#erent settings, and when applicable, we point to alternative approaches for representing these values. The idea is that by merging # This work was funded by an Australian Research Council SPIRT Grant entitled "Selfdescribing transactions operating in a open, heterogeneous and distributed environment" involving QUT and GBST Holdings Pty Ltd.  1  2  these individual approaches, and by mapping them into a unified notation, it is possible to design service description languages suitable for advertisement and matchmaking within specific application settings.  1.
