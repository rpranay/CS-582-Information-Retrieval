UML for Behavior-Oriented Multi-Agent Simulations Developing multi-agent simulations seems to be rather straight  forward, as active entities in the original correspond to active agents in  the model. Thus plausible behaviors can be produced rather easily. However,  for real world applications they must satisfy some requirements  concerning verification, validation and reproducibility. Using a standard  framework for designing a multi-agent model one can gain further advantages  like fast learnability, wide understandability and possible transfer.
