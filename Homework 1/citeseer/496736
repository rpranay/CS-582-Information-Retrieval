Flexible Interoperability in a Federated Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations Federated digital libraries are composed of autonomous, possibly heterogeneous information services distributed across the Internet. Federation provides users with a seamless, integrated view of the collected information. We are creating a  federated system for the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), an international consortium of  universities, libraries, and other supporting institutions focused on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The NDLTD  allows its members minimal restrictions and maximal autonomy, so federating requires dealing flexibly with differences among  ontologies, data formats, and finding aids involving several thousand ETDs in four formats and two languages.
