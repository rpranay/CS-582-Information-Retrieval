Secure Communication for Secure Agent-Based Electronic Commerce Applications Although electronic commerce is a relatively new concept, it  has already become a normal aspect of our daily life. The software agent  technology is also relatively new. In the area of electronic commerce, software  agents could be used for example to search for the lowest prices and  the best services, to buy goods on behalf of a user, etc. These applications  involve a number of security issues, such as communications security, system  security, and application security, that have to be solved. This paper  describes how communications security is added to a lightweight agent  framework. Secure agent-based electronic commerce applications require  communications security services. Adding these services is a rst basis  and an important enabler for the framework in order to be used for secure  electronic commerce applications.
