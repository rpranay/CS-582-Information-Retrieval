A Sound Algorithm for Region-Based Image Retrieval Using an Index Region-based image retrieval systems aim to improve the effectiveness of content-based search by decomposing each image into a set of "homogeneous" regions. Thus, similarity between images is assessed by computing similarity between pairs of regions and then combining the results at the image level. In this paper we propose the first provably sound algorithm for performing region-based similarity search when regions are accessed through an index. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as also compared to alternative retrieval strategies. 1. Introduction  Many real world applications, in the field of medicine, weather prediction, and communications, to name a few, require efficient access to image databases based on content. To this end, the goal of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is to define a set of properties (features) able to effectively characterize the content of images and then to use such features during retrieval. Users accessing a CB...
