Persona: A Contextualized and Personalized Web Search Recent advances in graph-based search techniques derived from Kleinberg's work [1] have been impressive. This paper further improves the graph-based search algo- rithm in two dimensions. Firstly, variants of Kleinberg's techniques do not take into account the semantics of the query string nor of the nodes being searched. As a result, polysemy of query words cannot be resolved. This paper presents an interactive query scheme utilizing the simple web ontology provided by the Open Directory Project to resolve meanings of a user query. Secondly, we extend a recently proposed personalized version of the Kleinberg algorithm [3]. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the sensitivity of our technique. We outline the implementation of our algorithm in the Persona personalized web search system.
