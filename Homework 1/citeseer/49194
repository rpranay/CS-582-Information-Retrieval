Modelling Rational Inquiry in Non-Ideal Agents The construction of rational agents is one of the goals that has been pursued in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In most of the architectures that have been proposed for this kind of agents, its behaviour is guided by its set of beliefs. In our work, rational agents are those systems that are permanently engaged in the process of rational inquiry; thus, their beliefs keep evolving in time, as a consequence of their internal inference procedures and their interaction with the environment. Both AI researchers and philosophers are interested in having a formal model of this process, and this is the main topic in our work. Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. We avoid these problems by replacing possible worlds by conceivable situations,  which ar...
