Personalized Information Management for Web Intelligence Web intelligence can be defined as the process of scanning and tracking information on the World Wide Web so as to gain competitive advantages. This paper describes a system known as Flexible Organizer for Competitive Intelligence (FOCI) that transforms raw URLs returned by internet search engines into personalized information portfolios. FOCI builds information portfolios by gathering and organizing on-line information according to a user's needs and preferences. Through a novel method called User-Configurable Clustering, a user can personalize his/her portfolios in terms of the content as well as the information structure. The personalized portfolios can then be used to track new information and organize them into appropriate folders accordingly. We show a sample session of FOCI which illustrates how a user may create and personalize an information portfolio according to his/her preferences and how the system discovers novel information groupings while organizing familiar information according to the userdefined themes.
