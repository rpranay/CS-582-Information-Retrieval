Steps Toward Accommodating Variable Position Tracking Accuracy in a Mobile Augmented Reality System The position-tracking accuracy of a location-aware mobile system can change dynamically as a function of the user's location and other variables specific to the tracker technology used. This is especially problematic for mobile augmented reality systems, which ideally require extremely precise position tracking for the user's head, but which may not always be able to achieve the necessary level of accuracy. While it is possible to ignore variable positional accuracy in an augmented reality user interface, this can make for a confusing system; for example, when accuracy is low, virtual objects that are nominally registered with real ones may be too far off to be of use.
