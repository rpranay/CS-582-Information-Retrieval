SQL Based Association Rule Mining using Commercial RDBMS (IBM DB2 UDB EEE) . Data mining is becoming increasingly important since the size of  databases grows even larger and the need to explore hidden rules from the  databases becomes widely recognized. Currently database systems are  dominated by relational database and the ability to perform data mining using  standard SQL queries will definitely ease implementation of data mining.  However the performance of SQL based data mining is known to fall behind  specialized implementation and expensive mining tools being on sale. In this  paper we present an evaluation of SQL based data mining on commercial  RDBMS (IBM DB2 UDB EEE). We examine some techniques to reduce I/O  cost by using View and Subquery. Those queries can be more than 6 times  faster than SETM SQL query reported previously. In addition, we have made  performance evaluation on parallel database environment and compared the  performance result with commercial data mining tool (IBM Intelligent Miner).  We prove that SQL based data mining can achie...
