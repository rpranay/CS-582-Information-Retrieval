Learning and Evaluating Visual Features for Pose Estimation We present a method for learning a set of visual landmarks which are useful for pose estimation. The landmark learning mechanism is designed to be applicable to a wide range of environments, and generalized for different approaches to computing a pose estimate. Initially, each landmark is detected as a local extremum of a measure of distinctiveness and represented by a principal components encoding which is exploited for matching. Attributes of the observed landmarks can be parameterized using a generic parameterization method and then evaluated in terms of their utility for pose estimation. We present experimental evidence that demonstrates the utility of the method. 1 Introduction In this paper, we develop an approach to visionbased robot localization by learning a set of imagedomain landmarks in the robot's environment. The landmarks are learned from a representative set of images obtained during an initial exploration of the environment. No a priori assumptions are made about the...
