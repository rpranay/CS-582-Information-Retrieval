Focused Web Crawling: A Generic Framework for Specifying the User Interest and for Adaptive Crawling Strategies Compared to the standard web search engines, focused  crawlers yield good recall as well as good  precision by restricting themselves to a limited domain.  In this paper, we do not introduce another focused  crawler, but we introduce a generic  framework for focused crawling consisting of two  major components: (1) Specification of the user interest  and measuring the resulting relevance of a  given web page. The proposed method of specifying  the user interest by a formula combining atomic  topics significantly improves the expressive  power of the user. (2) Crawling strategy. Ordering  the links at the crawl frontier is a challenging task  since pages of a low relevance may be on a path to  highly relevant pages. Thus, tunneling may be necessary.  The explicit specification of the user interest  allows us to define topic-specific strategies for  tunneling. Our system Ariadne is a prototype implementation  of the proposed framework. An experimental  evaluation of different crawling  strategies demonstrates the performance gain obtained  by focusing a crawl and by dynamically  adapting the focus.  1
