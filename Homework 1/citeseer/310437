Distance Metrics and Indexing Strategies for a Digital Library of Popular Music Introduction  Digital libraries until now could hardly be described as popular: they tend to be based on esoteric, scholarly sources close to the interests of digital library researchers themselves. We are developing a digital library containing the quintessence of popular culture: music. The principal mode of searching this library will be by sung query: the system should be able to answer the kinds of queries that shop assistants in music stores deal with every day, where a customer can sing a tune, but can't remember the title or artist.  The operation of our musical digital library is sketched in Figure 1. At the time of collection creation, MIDI files are gathered from the internet, and indexed based on their note sequences. At retrieval time, a user's sung query is transformed from a waveform to a sequence of pitch-duration events by a pitch tracker. We are using an off-the-shelf pitch tracker: pitch tracking is beyond the scope of the current project. Pot
