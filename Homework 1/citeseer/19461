Intelligent Diagnosis Systems This paper examines and compares several different approaches to the design of Intelligent Systems for Diagnosis and Advising applications. These include expert systems or knowledge-based systems, case-based reasoning systems, truth (or reason) maintenance systems, statistical pattern classification systems, decision trees, and artificial neural networks (or connectionist systems). The key aspects of each approach are demonstrated through the design of a system for a simple automobile fault diagnosis task. The paper also discusses the domain characteristics and design and performance requirements that influence the choice of a specific technique (or a combination of techniques) for a given application. 1 Introduction  The last few decades have seen a proliferation of intelligent systems for diagnosis, advising, forecasting, and related applications (Dean et al., 1995; Durkin, 1994; Ginsberg, 1993; Luger & Stubblefield, 1993; Puppe, 1993; Rich & Knight, 1991; Russell & Norvig, 1995; Ste...
