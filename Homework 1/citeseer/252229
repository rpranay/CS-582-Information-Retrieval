Agent-based Distributed Planning and Scheduling in Global Manufacturing Scheduling and resource allocation problems are pervasive and important in the management of industrial and government organizations. With advent of new technology and fast evolvement in industry, the enterprise is gradually moving toward global manufacturing for efficient operational management and competent strategic decision making. In the past two decades, researchers and practitioners have been applying various techniques (such as artificial intelligence, optimization methodologies, information system design, human factors, etc.) to design and develop planning and scheduling methodologies and systems for different applications. However, the inherent complexity of problems, short life-cycle of planner/scheduler, unrealistic investment of generous-purpose systems, and profligacy of scattering computing resource, accessibility, integration and re-configurability become the essential factors for new planners/schedulers in global manufacturing. The specific objectives of this research ...
