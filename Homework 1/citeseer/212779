Intelligent Information Access in the Web: ML based User Modeling for high precision Meta-Search It is a well known fact that high precision search for documents concerning a certain topic in the World Wide Web (Www) is a tough problem. Index based search engines vary in recall (with a coverage of at most 30% of the web) and offer a very bad precision by (simple) keyword search. Meta search engines provide a specialised monolithic architecture for information extraction, and integration of heterogenous information resources which ensures a bigger recall and may yield a better precision. Few search engines (as, e. g., HuskySearch) employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. On the other hand, many personalized agents for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of user modeling with machine learning (Ml) methods into web search services. We propose an abstract prototype, OySTER, which makes use of machine learning based user modeling and which for reasons of robustness, performance and quality is realised as a mult...
