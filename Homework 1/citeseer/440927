CREAM - Creating relational metadata with a component-based, ontology-driven annotation framework Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitutes the basis for  the Semantic Web. Annotating web documents is one of the major techniques for creating  metadata on the Web. However, annotation tools so far are restricted in their  capabilities of providing richly interlinked and truely machine-understandable data.  They basically allow the user to annotate with plain text according to a template structure,  such as Dublin Core. We here present CREAM (Creating RElational, Annotationbased  Metadata), a framework for an annotation environment that allows to construct  relational metadata, i.e. metadata that comprises class instances and relationship instances.  These instances are not based on a fix structure, but on a domain ontology.  We discuss some of the requirements one has to meet when developing such a framework,  e.g. the integration of a metadata crawler, inference services, document management  and information extraction, and describe its implementation, viz. Ont-O-Mat  a component-based, ontology-driven annotation tool.
