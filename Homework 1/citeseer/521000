Discovering Fuzzy Classification Rules with Genetic Programming and Co-Evolution In essence, data mining consists of extracting knowledge from  data. This paper proposes a co-evolutionary system for discovering fuzzy  classification rules. The system uses two evolutionary algorithms: a genetic  programming (GP) algorithm evolving a population of fuzzy rule sets and a  simple evolutionary algorithm evolving a population of membership function  definitions. The two populations co-evolve, so that the final result of the coevolutionary  process is a fuzzy rule set and a set of membership function  definitions which are well adapted to each other. In addition, our system also  has some innovative ideas with respect to the encoding of GP individuals representing  rule sets. The basic idea is that our individual encoding scheme incorporates  several syntactical restrictions that facilitate the handling of rule  sets in disjunctive normal form. We have also adapted GP operators to better  work with the proposed individual encoding scheme.
