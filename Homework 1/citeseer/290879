Support Vector Machines for Face Authentication The paper studies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the context of face  authentication. Our study supports the hypothesis that the SVM approach  is able to extract the relevant discriminatory information from the training  data. We believe this is the main reason for its superior performance over  benchmark methods. When the representation space already captures and  emphasises the discriminatory information content as in the case of Fisherfaces,  SVMs loose their superiority. SVMs can also cope with illumination  changes, provided these are adequately represented in the training data.  However, on data which has been sanitised by feature extraction (Fisherfaces)  and/or normalisation, SVMs can get over-trained, resulting in the loss of the  ability to generalise. SVMs involve many parameters and can employ different  kernels. This makes the optimisation space rather extensive, without the  guarantee that it has been fully explored to find the best solution.  1 Introduction  Verificat...
