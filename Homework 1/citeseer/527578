Text-Based Content Search and Retrieval in ad hoc P2P Communities We consider the problem of content search and retrieval in peer-to-peer (P2P) communities. P2P computing is a potentially powerful model for information sharing between ad hoc groups' of users because of its' low cost of entry and natural model for resource scaling with community size. As P2P communities grow in size, however, locating information distributed across the large number of peers becomes problematic. We present a distributed text-based content search and retrieval algorithm to address this' problem. Our algorithm is' based on a state-of-the-art text-based document ranking algorithm: the vector-space model instantiated with the TFxlDF ranking rule. A naive application of TFxlDF wouM require each peer in a community to collect an inverted index of the entire community. This' is' costly both in terms of bandwidth and storage. Instea & we show how TFxlDF can be approximated given compact summaries of peers' local inverted indexes. We make three contributions: (a) we show how the TFxlDF rule can be adapted to use the index summaries, (b) we provide a heuristic for adaptively determining the set of peers that shouM be contacted for a query, and (c) we show that our algorithm tracks' TFxlDF's performance very closely, regardless of how documents' are distributed throughout the community. Furthermore, our algorithm preserves the main flavor of TFxlDF by retrieving close to the same set of documents for any given query.
