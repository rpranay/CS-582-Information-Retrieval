Active User Interfaces The current state of user interfaces for large information spaces imposes an unmanageable cognitive burden upon the user. Determining how to get the right information into the right form with the right tool at the right time has become a monumental task. While advances in graphical user interfaces can partially address this problem, the basic problem of information overload--and under load--can not be solely addressed through development of a better direct manipulation interface to the information space. We survey the state of the art in two research fields, interface agents and user modeling, that address the problem of information overload and under load. First, we take a historical look at how the fields of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence have viewed interface agent research. Interface agents address the problem of increasing task load by serving as either an assistant or associate, extracting and analyzing relevant information, providing informatio...
