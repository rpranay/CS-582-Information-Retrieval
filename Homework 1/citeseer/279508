The coverage of the Web by each of the major search engines has been steadily decreasing despite their effort to index more web pages. Worse yet, as these search engines get larger, higher percentages of their indexed information are becoming obsolete. More and more people are having doubt about the scalability of centralized search engine technology. A more scalable alternative to search the Web is the metasearch engine approach. A metasearch engine can be considered as an interface on top of multiple local search engines to provide uniform access to many local search engines. Database selection is one of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine. The problem is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query.
