Evolution of a Central Pattern Generator for the Swimming and Trotting Gaits of the Salamander This paper presents the development of neural controllers for the swimming and the trotting of a salamanderlike animat. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we extend a connectionist model of the central pattern generator (CPG) controlling the swimming of a lamprey [1] to control the locomotion of a 2D mechanical simulation of a salamander. We study in particular what kind of neural connectivity can produce the traveling undulation of the trunk during swimming and the standing S-wave undulation during trotting. Using a GA, we evolve neural controllers which are made of two segmental oscillators controlling the fore- and hindlimb muscles, which project to a lamprey-like CPG for the trunk muscles. CPGs are successfully evolved which exhibit the swimming gait when external excitatory drive is applied only to the trunk CPG, and the trotting gait when external drive is applied to both the limb and the trunk CPGs. For both types of gaits, the speed of locomotion can be varied with the amplitude o...
