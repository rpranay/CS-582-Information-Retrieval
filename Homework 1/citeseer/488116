Agent-mediated Electronic Commerce: Scientific and Technological roadmap. this report is that a big part of Internet users have already sampled buying over the web (f.i. 40% in the UK), and a significat part qualify themselves as regular shoppers (f.i. 10% in the UK). Again, important differences between countries may be detected with respect to the expenses produced. For instance, Finland spent 20 times more that Spain on a per capita basis. The forecasts for European buying goods and services for the year 2002 suggest that the current 5.2 million shoppers will increase until 28.8 millions, and the European revenues from the current EUR3,032 million to EUR57,210 million. Finally, a significant increase in the number of European executives that believe in the future of electronic commerce has been observed (33% in 1999 up from 23% in 1998)
