Database Replication Using Epidemic Communication . There is a growing interest in asynchronous replica management  protocols in which database transactions are executed locally, and  their effects are incorporated asynchronously on remote database copies.  In this paper we investigate an epidemic update protocol that guarantees  consistency and serializability in spite of a write-anywhere capability  and conduct simulation experiments to evaluate this protocol. Our results  indicate that this epidemic approach is indeed a viable alternative  to eager update protocols for a distributed database environment where  serializability is needed.  1 Introduction  Data replication in distributed databases is an important problem that has been investigated extensively. In spite of numerous proposals, the solution to efficient access of replicated data remains elusive. Data replication has long been touted as a technique for improved performance and high reliability in distributed databases. Unfortunately, data replication has not delivered on ...
