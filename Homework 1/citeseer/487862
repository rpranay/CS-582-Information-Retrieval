Cross Entropy Guided Ant-like Agents Finding Dependable Primary/Backup Path Patterns in Networks Telecommunication network owners and operators have for half a century been well aware of the potential loss of revenue if a major trunk is damaged, thus dependability at high cost has been implemented. A simple, effective and common dependability scheme is 1:1 protection with 100% capacity redundancy in the network. A growing number of applications in need of dependable connections with specific requirements to bandwidth and delay have started using the internet (which only provides best effort transport) as their base communication service. In this paper we adopt the 1:1 protection scheme and incorporate it as part of a routing system applicable for internet infrastructures. 100% capacity redundancy is no longer required. A distributed stochastic path finding (routing) algorithm based on Rubinstein's Cross Entropy method for combinatorial optimisation is presented. Early results from Monte Carlo simulations indeed indicate that the algorithm is capable of finding pairs of independent primary and backup paths satisfying specific bandwidth a constraints.
