Beyond Euclidean Eigenspaces: Bayesian Matching for Visual Recognition We propose a novel technique for direct visual matching of images for the purposes of face  recognition and database search. Speci#cally,we argue in favor of a probabilistic measure of  similarity, in contrast to simpler methods which are based on standard Euclidean L2 norms #e.g.,  template matching# or subspace-restricted norms #e.g., eigenspace matching#. The proposed  similarity measure is based on a Bayesian analysis of image di#erences: we model twomutually  exclusive classes of variation between two facial images: intra-personal #variations in appearance  of the same individual, due to di#erent expressions or lighting# and extra-personal #variations in  appearance due to a di#erence in identity#. The high-dimensional probability density functions  for each respective class are then obtained from training data using an eigenspace density  estimation technique and subsequently used to compute a similarity measure based on the a  posteriori probability of membership in the intra-personal class, which is used to rank matches  in the database. The performance advantage of this probabilistic matching technique over  standard Euclidean nearest-neighbor eigenspace matching is demonstrated using results from  ARPA's 1996 #FERET" face recognition competition, in which this algorithm was found to be  the top performer.
