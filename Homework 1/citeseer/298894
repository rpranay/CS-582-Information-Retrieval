Problem solving in ID-logic with aggregates: some experiments The goal of the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven is  to design an expressive logic, suitable for declarative  knowledge representation, and to develop intelligent  systems based on Logic Programming technology for  solving computational problems using the declarative  specications. The ID-logic is an integration of typed  classical logic and a denition logic. Dierent abductive  solvers for this language are being developed. This  paper is a report of the integration of high order aggregates  into ID-logic and the consequences on the solver  SLDNFA.
