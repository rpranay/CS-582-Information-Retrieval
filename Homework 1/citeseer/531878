Experiences Developing a Thin-Client, Multi-Device Travel Planning Application Many applications now require access from diverse humancomputer interaction devices, such as desktop computers, web browsers, PDAs, mobile phones, pagers and so on. We describe our experiences developing a multi-device travel planning application built from reusable components, many of these developed from several different previous projects. We focus on key user interface design and component adaptation and integration issues as encountered in this problem domain. We report on the results of a useability evaluation of our prototype and our current research directions addressing HCI and interface development problems we encountered.
