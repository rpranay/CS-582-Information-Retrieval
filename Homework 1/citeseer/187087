Supporting Conflict Management in Cooperative Design Teams The design of complex artifacts has increasingly become a cooperative process, with the detection and resolution of conflicts between design agents playing a central role. Effective tools for supporting the conflict management process, however, are still lacking. This paper describes a system called DCSS (the Design Collaboration Support System) developed to meet this challenge in design teams with both human and machine-based agents. Every design agent is provided with an "assistant" that provides domain-independent conflict detection, classification and resolution expertise. The design agents provide the domainspecific expertise needed to instantiate this general expertise, including the rationale for their actions, as a part of their design activities. DCSS has been used successfully to support the cooperative design of Local Area Networks by human and machine-based designers. This paper includes a description of DCSS's underlying model and implementation, examples of  its operation...
