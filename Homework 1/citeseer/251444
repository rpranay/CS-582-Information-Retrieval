Probabilistic Object Bases There are many applications where an object oriented data model is a good way of representing  and querying data. However, current object database systems are unable to handle the  case of objects whose attributes are uncertain. In this paper, extending previous pioneering work  by Kornatzky and Shimony, we develop an extension of the relational algebra to the case of object  bases with uncertainty. We propose concepts of consistency for such object bases, together  with an NP-completeness result, and classes of probabilistic object bases for which consistency  is polynomially checkable. In addition, as certain operations involve conjunctions and disjunctions  of events, and as the probability of conjunctive and disjunctive events depends both on the  probabilities of the primitive events involved as well as on what is known (if anything) about the  relationship between the events, we show how all our algebraic operations may be performed  under arbitrary probabilistic conjunction and ...
