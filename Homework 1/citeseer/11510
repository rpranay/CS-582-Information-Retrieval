The CMUnited-97 Simulator Team . The Soccer Server system provides a rich and challenging multiagent, real-time domain. Agents must accurately perceive and act despite a quickly changing, largely hidden, noisy world. They must also act at several levels, ranging from individual skills to full-team collaborative and adversarial behaviors. This article presents the CMUnited-97 approaches to the above challenges which helped the team to the semifinals of the 29-team RoboCup-97 tournament. 1 Introduction  The Soccer Server system [5] used at RoboCup-97 [2] provides a rich and challenging multiagent, real-time domain. Sensing and acting is noisy, while interagent communication is unreliable and low-bandwidth. In order to be successful, each agent in a team must be able to sense and act in real time: sensations arrive at unpredictable intervals while actions are possible every 100ms. Furthermore, since the agents get local, noisy sensory information, they must have a method of converting their sensory inputs into a good w...
