Modeling Emotion-Based Decision-Making This paper presents a computational approach to EmotionBased Decision-Making that models important aspects of emotional processing and integrates these with other models of perception, motivation, behavior, and motor control. A particular emphasis is placed on using some of the mechanisms of emotions as building blocks for the acquisition of emotional memories that serve as biasing signals during the process of making decisions and selecting actions. We have successfully followed this approach to develop and control several different autonomous agents, including both synthetic agents and physical robots.  Introduction  Most theories of human reasoning and decision-making fall between two different positions. The first one argues that we make decisions in a way similar to that of solving problems in formal logic. According to this view, when faced with a problem, we form a list of all different options and their possible outcomes, and then we use logic in its best sense to perform a cos...
