Chart of Darkness: Mapping a Large Intranet We introduce and de ne the concept of dark matter on the Web. Dark matter for a person or Web crawler consists of pages that they cannot reach and view, but which another observer can. Dark matter is important to our understanding of the Web in that the portion of the Web any of us can see depends on our viewpoint. Diffrent observers see different overlapping sections of the Web. However, no one can see all of the Web, even if they want to. We categorise the various types of dark matter that exist and how they may be discovered. Formal definitions of what constitutes lightness and darkness on the Web are formulated in terms of reachability. Our case study of dark matter within the Australian National University's intranet is reported. We estimate that 87% of the ANU intranet's information is dark to our local search service, and 37% is potentially loadable Web data unreachable to almost every Web user. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of dark matter for estimating the size of the Web and for general Web searching.
