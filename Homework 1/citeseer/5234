A Case Study on Case-Based and Symbolic Learning (Extended Abstract) )  Stefan Wess and Christoph Globig  University of Kaiserslautern, P.O. Box 3049 D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany  fwess, globigg@informatik.uni-kl.de Abstract  Contrary to symbolic learning approaches, which represent a learned concept explicitly, case-based approaches describe concepts implicitly by a pair (CB;sim), i.e. by a measure of similarity sim and a set CB of cases. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning the learning power of the two approaches. In this article we will study the relationship between the case base, the measure of similarity, and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the hypothesis of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and case-based methods and show the interdependency between the measure used by a case-based algorithm and the target concept.
