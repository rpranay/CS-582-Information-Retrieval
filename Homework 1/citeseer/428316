Haptic Perception of Virtual Roughness The texture of a virtual surface can both increase the sense of realism of an object as well as convey information about object identity, type, location, function, and so on. It is crucial therefore that interface designers know the range of textural information available through the haptic modality in virtual environments. The current study involves participants making roughness judgments on pairs of haptic textures experienced through a force-feedback device. The effect of texture frequency on roughness perception is analysed. The potential range and resolution of textural information available through force-feedback interaction are discussed.  Keywords  Haptics, force-feedback, texture perception.  INTRODUCTION  Despite the increasing prevalence of haptics in today's computing environments, the effective representation of haptic information is still a relatively new design problem for human computer interaction research. Force feedback interfaces in particular pose a variety of desi...
