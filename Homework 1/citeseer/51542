Reasoning with Concrete Domains Description logics are knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms  which represent conceptual knowledge on an abstract logical  level. Concrete domains are a theoretically well-founded approach to  the integration of description logic reasoning with reasoning about  concrete objects such as numbers, time intervals or spatial regions. In  this paper, the complexity of combined reasoning with description logics  and concrete domains is investigated. We extend ALC(D), which  is the basic description logic for reasoning with concrete domains, by  the operators "feature agreement" and "feature disagreement". For  the extended logic, called ALCF(D), an algorithm for deciding the  ABox consistency problem is devised. The strategy employed by this  algorithm is vital for the efficient implementation of reasoners for description  logics incorporating concrete domains. Based on the algorithm,  it is proved that the standard reasoning problems for both  logics ALC(D) and ALCF(D) are PSpace-co...
