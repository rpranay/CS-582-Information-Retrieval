Optimizing Object Queries Using an Effective Calculus Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data abstractions and modeling facilities but they generally lack a suitable framework for query processing and optimization. One of the key factors for OODB systems to successfully compete with relational systems as well as to meet the performance requirements of many non-traditional applications is the development of an effective query optimizer. We propose an effective framework with a solid theoretical basis for optimizing OODB query languages. Our calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus, captures most features of ODMG OQL and is a good basis for expressing various optimization algorithms concisely. This paper concentrates on query unnesting, an optimization that, even though improves performance considerably, is not treated properly (if at all) by most OODB systems. Our framework generalizes many unnesting techniques proposed recently in the literature and is capable of removing any form of query nesting using a very si...
