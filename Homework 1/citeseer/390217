Autonomous Robot that Uses Symbol Recognition and Artificial Emotion to Attend the AAAI Conference This paper describes our approach in designing an autonomous  robot for the AAAI Mobile Robot Challenge,  making the robot attend the National Conference on AI.  The goal was to do a simplified version of the whole  task, by integrating methodologies developed in various  research projects conducted in our laboratory. Original  contributions are the use of a symbol recognition technique  to make the robot read signs, artificial emotion for  expressing the state of the robot in the accomplishment  of its goals, a touch screen for human-robot interaction,  and a charging station for allowing the robot to recharge  when necessary. All of these aspects are influenced by  the different steps to be followed by the robot attendee  to complete the task from start-to-end.  Introduction  LABORIUS is a young research laboratory interested in designing autonomous systems that can assist human in real life tasks. To do so, robots need some sort of "social intelligence ", giving them the ability to ...
