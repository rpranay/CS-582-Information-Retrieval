Single Display Groupware: Exploring Computer Support for Co-located Collaboration This panel will explore an interaction paradigm for colocated computer-based collaboration we term Single Display Groupware (SDG). SDG is a class of applications that support multiple simultaneous users interacting in the same room on a single shared display with multiple inputdevices. SDG are being used in various applications in the educational, entertainment and research communities, but many issues remain to be explored.  Keywords  Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW); computersupported collaborative learning (CSCL); computersupported collaborative entertainment (CSCE), multiple input devices.  INTRODUCTION  Single Display Groupware (SDG) is a class of applications that support multiple simultaneous users interacting in a colocated environment on a single shared display with multiple input-devices [4]. SDG allows users to interact more naturally and comfortably around the computer. Such applications take advantage of our human ability to interact and communicate in a face-to-...
