On2broker: Semantic-Based Access to Information Sources at the WWW On2broker provides brokering services to improve access to heterogeneous, distributed and semistructured information sources as they are presented in the World Wide Web. It relies on the use of ontologies to make explicit the semantics of web pages. In the paper we will discuss the general architecture and main components of On2broker and provide some application scenarios.  1. Introduction  In the paper we describe a tool environment called On2broker  1  that processes information sources and content descriptions in HTML, XML, and RDF and that provides intelligent information retrieval, query answering and maintenance support. Central for our approach is the use of ontologies to describe background knowledge and to make explicit the semantics of web documents. Ontologies have been developed in the area of knowledge-based systems for structuring and reusing large bodies of knowledge (cf. CYC [Lenat, 1995], (KA)2 [Benjamins et al., 1998]). Ontologies are consensual and formal specificat...
