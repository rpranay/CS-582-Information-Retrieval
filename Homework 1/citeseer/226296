A Social Semantics for Agent Communication Languages . The ability to communicate is one of the salient properties  of agents. Although a number of agent communication languages (ACLs)  have been developed, obtaining a suitable formal semantics for ACLs remains  one of the greatest challenges of multiagent systems theory. Previous  semantics have largely been mentalistic in their orientation and  are based solely on the beliefs and intentions of the participating agents.  Such semantics are not suitable for most multiagent applications, which  involve autonomous and heterogeneous agents, whose beliefs and intentions  cannot be uniformly determined. Accordingly, we present a social  semantics for ACLs that gives primacy to the interactions among the  agents. Our semantics is based on social commitments and is developed  in temporal logic. This semantics, because of its public orientation, is  essential to providing a rigorous basis for multiagent protocols.  1 Introduction  Interaction among agents is the distinguishing property of multia...
