Answering Queries by Semantic Caches There has been growing interest in semantic query caches to  aid in query evaluation. Semantic caches are simply the results of previously  asked queries, or selected relational information chosen by an evaluation  strategy, that have been cached locally. For complex environments  such as distributed, heterogeneous databases and data warehousing, the  use of semantic caches promises to help optimize query evaluation, increase  turnaround for users, and reduce network load and other resource  usage. We present a general logical framework for semantic caches. We  consider the use of all relational operations across the caches for answering  queries, and we consider the various ways to answer, and to partially  answer, a query by cache. We address when answers are in cache, when  answers in cache can be recovered, and the notions of semantic overlaps,  semantic independence, and semantic query remainder.  While there has been much work relevant to the use of semantic caches,  no one has addressed in conjunction the issues pertinent to the effective  use of semantic caches to evaluate queries. In some cases, this is due to  overly simplified assumptions, and in other cases to the lack of a formal  framework. We attempt to establish some of that framework here. Within  that framework, we illustrate the issues involved in using semantic caches  for query evaluation. We show various applications for semantic caches,  and relate the work to relevant areas.  1
