Processing Fuzzy Spatial Queries: A Configuration Similarity Approach . Increasing interest for configuration similarity is currently developing in the context of Digital Libraries, Spatial Databases and Geographical Information Systems. The corresponding queries retrieve all database configurations that match an input description (e.g., "find all configurations where an object x 0 is about 5km northeast of another x 1 , which, in turn, is inside object x 2 "). This paper introduces a framework for configuration similarity that takes into account all major types of spatial constraints (topological, direction, distance). We define appropriate fuzzy similarity measures for each type of constraint to provide flexibility and allow the system to capture real-life needs. Then we apply pre-processing techniques to explicate constraints in the query, and present algorithms that effectively solve the problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our approach to images and queries of considerable size. 1. INTRODUCTION As opposed to visu...
