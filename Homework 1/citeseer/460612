Routing Through the Mist: Privacy Preserving Communication in Ubiquitous Computing Environments Ubiquitous computing is poised to revolutionize the way we compute and interact with each other. However, unless privacy concerns are taken into account early in the design process, we will end up creating a very effective distributed surveillance system, which would be a dream come true for electronic stalkers and "big brothers. " We present a protocol, which preserves the privacy of users and keeps their communication anonymous. In effect, we create a "mist" that conceals users from the system and other users. Yet, users will still be able to enjoy seamless interaction with services and other entities that wander within the ubiquitous computing environment.
