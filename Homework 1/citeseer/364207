The KRAFT Architecture for Knowledge Fusion and Transformation This paper describes the KRAFT architecture which supports the fusion of knowledge  from multiple, distributed, heterogeneous sources. The architecture uses  constraints as a common knowledge interchange format, expressed against a common  ontology. Knowledge held in local sources can be tranformed into the common  constraint language, and fused with knowledge from other sources. The  fused knowledge is then used to solve some problem or deliver some information  to a user. Problem-solving in KRAFT typically exploits pre-existing constraint  solvers. KRAFT uses an open and flexible agent architecture in which knowledge  sources, knowledge fusing entities, and users are all represented by independent  KRAFT agents, communicating using a messaging protocol. Facilitator agents  perform matchmaking and brokerage services between the various kinds of agent.  KRAFT is being applied to an example application in the domain of network data  services design.  1 Introduction and Motivation  Most ...
