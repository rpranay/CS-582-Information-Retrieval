Reclustering of HEP Data in Object-Oriented Databases The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), build at CERN, will enter operation in 2005. The experiments at the LHC will generate some 5 PB of data per year, which are stored in an ODBMS.  A good object clustering on the disk drives will be critical to achieve a high data throughput required by future analysis scenarios. This paper presents a new reclustering algorithm for HEP data that maximizes the read transfer rate for objects contained in multiple overlapping collections. It works by decomposing the stored objects into a number of chunks and rearranging them by means of heuristics solving the traveling salesman problem with Hamming distance. Furthermore experimental results of a prototype are presented.  Keywords: object-oriented databases, scientific databases, object clustering, query optimisation  1 Introduction  The ATLAS experiment [1] at CERN, due to take data in the year 2005 will store approximately 1 PB (10  15  bytes) of data per year. Data taking is expected to last 15 or more yea...
