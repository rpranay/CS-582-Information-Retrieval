CS 395T Large-Scale Data Mining Fall 2001 ojects the vectors x 1 : : : x n onto the principal components. Note that the eigenvectors of ^   are the left singular vectors of the matrix 1  p  n 1 [x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n ]: Thus PCA can be obtained from the SVD of mean centered data. The mean centering is the important dierence between PCA and SVD and can yield qualitatively dierent results for data sets where the mean is not equal to 0, as shown in gure 1.

Usually, the clustering problem is posed as a
