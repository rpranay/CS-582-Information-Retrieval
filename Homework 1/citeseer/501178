Supporting Internet-Scale Multi-Agent Systems ts a model of AgentScape from the agent perspective, that is, the location comprising the middleware and the resources are represented by a location manager agent and resource objects. Calls from an agent to the middleware are modeled by requests to the location manager agent to, for example, create an agent or move an agent. Information about resources residing at the location can be retrieved by binding to the resource objects, which are local distributed objects. These objects can be accessed only within the location they reside, not from outside the location.  For development of agent applications, an application programming interface (API) and a runtime system (RTS) are provided, see Fig. 1. The default API and RTS can be extended to provide a higher-level application programming interface with, for example, a model that offers more structure and semantics to the agent application developer.  Within AgentScape, management of large-scale agent systems is an important issue, includi
