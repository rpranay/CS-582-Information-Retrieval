Using Explicit Requirements and Metrics for Interface Agent User Model Correction The complexity of current computer systems and software warrants  research into methods to decrease the cognitive load on users.  Determining how to get the right information into the right form with  the right tool at the right time has become a monumental task --- one  necessitating intelligent interfaces agents with the ability to predict  the users' needs or intent.  An accurate user model is considered necessary for effective prediction  of user intent. Methods for maintaining accurate user models  is the main thrust of this paper. We describe an approach for dynamically  correcting an interface agent's user model based on utility-theory.  We explicitly take into account an agent's requirements and metrics  for measuring the agent's effectiveness of meeting those requirements.  Using these requirements and metrics, we develop a requirements utility  function that determines when a user model should be corrected  and how. We present a correction model based on a multi-agent bidding...
