A Scalable and Ontology-Based P2P Infrastructure for Semantic Web Services Semantic Web Services are a promising combination of Semantic Web and Web service technology, aiming at providing means of automatically executing, discovering and composing semantically marked-up Web services. We envision peer-to-peer networks which allow for carrying out searches in real-time on permanently reconfiguring networks to be an ideal injastructure for deploying a network of Semantic Web Service providers. However, P2P networks evolving in an unorganized manner suffer jom serious scalability problems, limiting the number of nodes in the network, creating network overload and pushing search times to unacceptable limits. We address these problems by imposing a deterministic shape on P2P networks: We propose a graph topology which allows for very efficient broadcast and search, and we provide an efficient topology construction and maintenance algorithm which, crucial to symmetric peer-to-peer networks, does neither require a central server nor super nodes in the network. We show how our scheme can be made even more efficient by using a globally known ontology to determine the organization of peers in the graph topology, allowing for efficient concept-based search.
