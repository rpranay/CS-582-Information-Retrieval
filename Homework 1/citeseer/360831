Exploring Brick-Based Navigation and Composition in an Augmented Reality . BUILD-IT is a planning tool based on computer vision technology,  supporting complex planning and composition tasks. A group of people, seated  around a table, interact with objects in a virtual scene using real bricks. A plan  view of the scene is projected onto the table, where object manipulation takes  place. A perspective view is projected on the wall. The views are set by virtual  cameras, having spatial attributes like shift, rotation and zoom. However, planar  interaction with bricks provides only position and rotation information. Object  height control is equally constrained by planar interaction. The aim of this paper  is to suggest methods and tools bridging the gap between planar interaction and  three-dimensional control. To control camera attributes, active objects, with intelligent  behaviour are introduced. To control object height, several real and  virtual tools are suggested. Some of the solutions are based on metaphors, like  window, sliding-ruler and floor.  1 I...
