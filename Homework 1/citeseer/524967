Searching People on the Web According to Their Interests Due to lack of structural data and information explosion on the World Wide Web (WWW), searching for useful information is becoming increasingly a difficult task. Traditional search engines on the Web render some form of assistance, but perform sub-optimally when dealing with context sensitive queries. To overcome this, niche search engines serving specific Web communities evolved. These engines index only pages of high quality and relevance to a specific domain and make use of context information for searching. This poster presents BullsI Search (publicly available at http://dm2.comp.nus.edu.sg), a fielded domain specific search engine that helps Web users locate computer science faculty members' homepages and email addresses by specifying a research interest, teaching interest or name. The system is able to automatically extract and index research interests, teaching interests, owners' email addresses and names from a set of discovered homepages. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are very accurate and are independent of structures in different homepages.
