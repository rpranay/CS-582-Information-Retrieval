Selecting a Fuzzy Logic Operation from the DNF-CNF Interval: How Practical Are the Resulting Operations? In classical (two-valued) logic, CNF and DNF  forms of each propositional formula are equivalent  to each other. In fuzzy logic, CNF and  DNF forms are not equivalent, they form an interval  that contains the fuzzy values of all classically  equivalent propositional formulas. If we  want to select a single value from this interval,  then it is natural to select a linear combination  of the interval's endpoints. In particular, we  can do that for CNF and DNF forms of "and"  and "or", thus designing natural fuzzy analogues  of classical "and" and "or" operations.
