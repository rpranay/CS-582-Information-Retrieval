Evolution and Revolutions in LDAP Directory Caches . LDAP directories have recently proliferated with the growth  of the Internet, and are being used in a wide variety of network-based  applications. In this paper, we propose the use of generalized queries,  referred to as query templates, obtained by generalizing individual user  queries, as the semantic basis for low overhead, high benefit LDAP directory  caches for handling declarative queries. We present efficient incremental  algorithms that, given a sequence of user queries, maintain a  set of potentially beneficial candidate query templates, and select a subset  of these candidates for admission into the directory cache. A novel  feature of our algorithms is their ability to deal with overlapping query  templates. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of template caches  over query caches, with an experimental study based on real data and a  prototype implementation of the LDAP directory cache.  1 Introduction  LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) network directories ha...
