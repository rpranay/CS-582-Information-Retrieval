Mining Usability Information from Log Files: AMulti-Pronged Approach rooms is configurable by its occupants in how they organize various tools housing their data, documents, and graphics. The TW system provides for synchronous and asynchronous user interactions, but importantly these interactions are in the context of relevant data. The work in this experiment was characterized by several full group meetings (for planning and coordination) interspersed with periods of individual activity (asychronous work) and smaller coordination meetings of two or three team members around the "hand-off" of output from a task used as input for another task.

This set of interactions was deemed too rudimentary for capturing the type of data needed for usability analysis. Since the source co
