Hybrid Neural Systems   This chapter provides an introduction to the eld of hybrid  neural systems. Hybrid neural systems are computational systems which  are based mainly on articial neural networks but also allow a symbolic  interpretation or interaction with symbolic components. In this overview,  we will describe recent results of hybrid neural systems. We will give  a brief overview of the main methods used, outline the work that is  presented here, and provide additional references. We will also highlight  some important general issues and trends.
