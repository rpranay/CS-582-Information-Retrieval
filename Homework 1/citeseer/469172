Mindless Visualisations The wonder and, unfortunately, to the detriment of visualisation for the representation and  comprehension of complex data sets is that to be most successful requires that they are tailored to suit  the task and underlying data. Such a restriction enables visualisations to be well designed for the tasks  to which they are known to be applied to, and also to accommodate the style and range of data to be  expected as normal. The problem with this repeated redesign of visualisations is that the interface is  often neglected, and can even be solely dependent on the implementing technology used for the  visualisation. It is important to add such issues as the interface to visualisation considerations, and to  provide reusable concepts that will integrate with a range of metaphors and displays. This position  paper examines the issues surrounding such visualisation interfaces and presents a discussion of those  issues.  1.
