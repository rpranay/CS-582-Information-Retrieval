Speech and Hand Transcribed Retrieval This paper describes the issues and preliminary work involved in the creation of an information retrieval system that will manage the retrieval from collections composed of both speech recognised and ordinary text documents. In previous work, it has been shown that because of recognition errors, ordinary documents are generally retrieved in preference to recognised ones. Means of correcting or eliminating the observed bias is the subject of this paper. Initial ideas and some preliminary results are presented.  General Terms  Measurement, Experimentation.  Keywords  Information Retrieval, Spoken Document Retrieval, Mixed Collections.  1.
