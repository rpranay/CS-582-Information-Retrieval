NetView: A Framework for Integration of Large-Scale Distributed Visual Databases Many visual databases (including image and video databases) are being designed in various locations. The integration of such databases enables users to access data across the world in a transparent manner. In this article, we present a system framework, termed NetView, which supports global content-based query access to various visual databases over the Internet. An integrated metaserver is designed to facilitate such access. The metaserver contains three main components: the metadatabase, the metasearch agent, and the query manager. The metadatabase is organized to include the metadata about individual visual databases which reflect the semantics of each visual database. The query manager extracts heterogeneous features such as text, texture, and color in the query for suitable matching of the metadata. The metasearch agent derives a list of relevant database sites to the given query by matching their feature content with the metadata. Such a capability can significantly reduce the a...
