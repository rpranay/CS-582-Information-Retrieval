Towards a Living Lab research facility and a ubiquitous computing research programme Introduction  My interest in the topic of this workshop stems from my current involvement in setting up a new research facility at the Eindhoven University of Technology. This facility is called the 'Living Lab', and is quite similar to related projects around the globe in that it aims to study how people experience a ubiquitous computing environment, when they will inhabit it and use it for prolonged periods of time. The slogan of this development, is 'Vacation on Campus'.  The project is currently at the initiation phase. We have proposed a white paper [1] describing the concept and the research programme, and we are currently working to involve stakeholders from different departments of the TU/e, e.g., Architecture, Electrical Engineering, and Technology Management, and of the local industry. (E.g., Philips).  In the remaining of this position paper, I outline our research concept and our programme.  Concept - Vacation on Campus  The Living Lab, will be a cros
