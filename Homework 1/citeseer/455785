Methods for Sampling Pages Uniformly from the World Wide Web We present two new algorithms for generating uniformly  random samples of pages from the World Wide Web, building  upon recent work by Henzinger et al. (Henzinger et al.  2000) and Bar-Yossef et al. (Bar-Yossef et al. 2000). Both  algorithms are based on a weighted random-walk methodology.  The first algorithm (DIRECTED-SAMPLE) operates  on arbitrary directed graphs, and so is naturally applicable  to the web. We show that, in the limit, this algorithm  generates samples that are uniformly random. The second  algorithm (UNDIRECTED-SAMPLE) operates on undirected  graphs, thus requiring a mechanism for obtaining inbound  links to web pages (e.g., access to a search engine). With  this additional knowledge of inbound links, the algorithm  can arrive at a uniform distribution faster than DIRECTEDSAMPLE,  and we derive explicit bounds on the time to convergence.  In addition, we evaluate the two algorithms on  simulated web data, showing that both yield reliably uniform  samples of pages. We also compare our results with those of  previous algorithms, and discuss the theoretical relationships  among the various proposed methods.
