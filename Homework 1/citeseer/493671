sView - Architecture Overview and System Description This report presents an architecture overview and a system description of the sView system. The system provides developers, service providers, and users of electronic services with an open and extendible service infrastructure that allows far-reaching user control. This is accomplished by collecting the services of an individual user in a virtual briefcase. Services come in the form of self-contained service components (i.e. including both logic and data), and the briefcase is mobile to allow it to follow as the user moves between different hosts and terminals. A specification of how to build such service components and the infrastructure for handling briefcases is presented. A reference implementation of the specification as well as extensions in the form of service components is also described. The purpose of the report is to serve as a technical reference for developers of sView services and software infrastructure that builds on sView technology. Keywords. Electronic services, personal service environments, user interfaces, mobility, personalization, service collaboration, component-based software engineering.
