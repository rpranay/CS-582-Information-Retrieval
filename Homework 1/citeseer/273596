Experimental Results with Real-Time Scheduling Using DECAF DECAF [6] is a software toolkit for the rapid design, development, and execution of "intelligent" agents to achieve solutions in complex software systems. From a research community perspective, DECAF provides a modular platform for evaluating and disseminating results in agent architectures, including communication, planning, scheduling, execution monitoring, coordination, diagnosis, and learning. This paper will describe a methodology and results for building and evaluating execution schedules of agent actions in the DECAF architecture. A brief description of DECAF is provided describing how the modular design allows for testing of multiple scheduling algorithms. A description of the types of agents that were used to demonstrate three particular capabilities of DECAF; scalability, parallelism and the threaded nature of the architecture. Lastly, experiments using different scheduling algorithms were utilized to develop an experimental platform for future research in agent scheduling. F...
