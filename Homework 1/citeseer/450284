Smart-Its Friends: A Technique for Users to Easily Establish Connections between Smart Artefacts . Ubiquitous computing is associated with a vision of everything being  connected to everything. However, for successful applications to emerge, it will  not be the quantity but the quality and usefulness of connections that will  matter. Our concern is how qualitative relations and more selective connections  can be established between smart artefacts, and how users can retain control  over artefact interconnection. We propose context proximity for selective  artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We  further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose the  same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have  implemented Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become  connected when a user holds them together and shakes them.  1
