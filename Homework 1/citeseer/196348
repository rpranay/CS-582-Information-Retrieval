A Framework for Automated Construction and Transformation of Case-Based Reasoning Systems Case Based Reasoning systems have gained immense popularity over the recent  years as problem-solving tools. Most case based reasoning systems, however, are developed  essentially from scratch using proprietary systems and applications on a limited  number of platforms. Although methods have been proposed to describe the structure  of a case based reasoner, none of these have been very successful outside their  application domains. In this paper, we #rst describe common methods for automating  CBR system construction. We then describe a general model for common CBR implementation,  and describe in detail a framework of platform-independent construction  of systems based on this model. We discuss an implementation of such a system using  Java, and #nally describe ways systems can be developed using this framework.  1 Introduction  Achieving widespread case-based reasoning support for corporate memories will require #exibility in integrating implementations with existing organizational i...
