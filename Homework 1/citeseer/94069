An Intelligent Multi-Agent Architecture for Information Retrieval from the Internet The World Wide Web (WWW) offers an uncountable number of documents which deal with information from a neverending list of topics. Thus the question of whether to find information turned into a question of how to find relevant information. Search engines with crawler based indexes vary in recall and offer a very bad precision. Meta search engines try to overcome these lacks based upon a specialised monolithic architecture for information extraction, information filtering and integration of heterogenous information resources. Few search engines employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. On the other hand, user modeling techniques become more and more popular. Many personalized agent based system for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of user modeling with machine learning methods into web search services. We propose an abstract prototype which is being developed at the University of Osnabruck and which incorporat...
