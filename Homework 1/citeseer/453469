MRML: Towards an extensible standard for multimedia querying and benchmarking In recent years, the need for databases which query multimedia data by content has  become apparent. Many commercial and non--commercial research groups are trying  to fulfill these needs.  The development of research can be described as moving in two directions  ffl search for new, useful query and interaction paradigms  ffl deeper research to improve the performance of systems that have adopted a given  query paradigm.  The search for new better performance given a query paradigm has led to "clusters" of  systems which are similar in their interaction with the user, and which give a certain  set of interaction capabilities to the user.  It is already visible, that research will move towards systems which enable the user  to formulate multi--paradigm queries in order to further improve results.  As a consequence of the above, there is the need for  ffl A common mechanism for shipping multi--paradigm queries and their results ,  which assures that the right query processor processes th...
