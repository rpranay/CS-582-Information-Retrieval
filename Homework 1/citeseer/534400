Tinmith-Metro: New Outdoor Techniques for Creating City Models with an Augmented Reality Wearable Computer This paper presents new techniques for capturing and viewing on site 3D graphical models for large outdoor objects. Using an augmented reality wearable computer, we have developed a software system, known as TinmithMetro. Tinmith-Metro allows users to control a 3D constructive solid geometry modeller for building graphical objects of large physical artefacts, for example buildings, in the physical world. The 3D modeller is driven by a new user interface known as Tinmith-Hand, which allows the user to control the modeller using a set of pinch gloves and hand tracking. These techniques allow user to supply their AR renderers with models that would previously have to be captured with manual, time-consuming, and/or expensive methods.
