Incremental Learning of Control Knowledge For Nonlinear Problem Solving In this paper we advocate a learning method where a deductive  and an inductive strategies are combined to efficiently learn control  knowledge. The approach consists of initially bounding the explanation  to a predetermined set of problem solving features. Since there is no  proof that the set is sufficient to capture the correct and complete explanation  for the decisions, the control rules acquired are then refined,  if and when applied incorrectly to new examples. The method is especially  significant as it applies directly to nonlinear problem solving, where  the search space is complete. We present hamlet, a system where we  implemented this learning method, within the context of the prodigy  architecture. hamlet learns control rules for individual decisions corresponding  to new learning opportunities offered by the nonlinear problem  solver that go beyond the linear one. These opportunities involve, among  other issues, completeness, quality of plans, and opportunistic decision  making. Finally, we show empirical results illustrating hamlet's learning  performance.
