Signer-independent Continuous Sign Language Recognition Based on SRN/HMM A divide-and-conquer approach is presented for signer-independent  continuous Chinese Sign Language(CSL) recognition in this paper. The problem  of continuous CSL recognition is divided into the subproblems of isolated  CSL recognition. We combine the simple recurrent network(SRN) with the  hidden Markov models(HMM) in this approach. The improved SRN is introduced  for segmentation of continuous CSL. Outputs of SRN are regarded as the  states of HMM, and the Lattice Viterbi algorithm is employed to search the best  word sequence in the HMM framework. Experimental results show SRN/HMM  approach has better performance than the standard HMM one.
