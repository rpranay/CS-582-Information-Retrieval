Return from the Ant - Synthetic Ecosystems for Manufacturing Control The synthetic ecosystems approach attempts to adopt basic principles of natural ecosystems in the design of multiagent systems. Natural agent systems like insect colonies are fascinating in that they are robust, flexible, and adaptive. Made up of millions of very simple entities, these systems express a highly complex and coordinated global behavior. There are several branches in different sciences, for instance in biology, physics, economics, or in computer science, that focus on distributed systems of locally interacting entities. Their research yields a number of commonly observed characteristics. To supply engineered systems with similar characteristics this thesis proposes a set of principles that should be observed when designing synthetic ecosystems. Each principle is systematically stated and motivated, and its consequences for the manufacturing control domain are discussed. Stigmergy has shown its usefulness in the coordination of large crowds of agents in a synthetic ecosystem...
