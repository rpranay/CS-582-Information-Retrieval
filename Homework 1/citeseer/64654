Estimating Dependency Structure as a Hidden Variable This paper introduces a probability model, the mixture of trees that can account for sparse, dynamically changing dependence relationships. We present a family of efficient algorithms that use EM and the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to find the ML and MAP mixture of trees for a variety of priors, including the Dirichlet and the MDL priors.  1 INTRODUCTION  A fundamental feature of a good model is the ability to uncover and exploit independencies in the data it is presented with. For many commonly used models, such as neural nets and belief networks, the dependency structure encoded in the model is fixed, in the sense that it is not allowed to vary depending on actual values of the variables or with the current case. However, dependency structures that are conditional on values of variables abound in the world around us. Consider for example bitmaps of handwritten digits. They obviously contain many dependencies between pixels; however, the pattern of these dependencies will vary acr...
