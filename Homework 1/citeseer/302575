Leveled Commitment Contracts and Strategic Breach In automated negotiation systems for self-interested agents, contracts have traditionallybeen binding. Theydo not accommodate future events. Contingency contracts address this, but are often impractical. As an alternative, we propose le???eled commitment contracts. The level of commitment is set bybreach penalties. To be freed from the contract, an agent simply pays the penalty to the other party. A self-interested agent will be reluctant to breach because the other partymight breach, in which case the former agent is freed from the contract, does not incur a penalty, and collects a penalty from the breacher. We show that, despite such strategic breach, leveled commitment increases the expected payoff to both contract parties and can enable deals that are impossible under full commitment. Asymmetric beliefs are also discussed. Different decommitting mechanisms are introduced and compared. Practical prescriptions for market designers are provided. A contract optimizer is provided on the web. Journal ofEconomic Literature
