Cyber-Atvs: Dynamic And Distributed Reconnaissance And Surveilllance Using All Terrain Ugvs This paper describes our current effort to develop robotic vehicles for tactical distributed surveillance. Our research is focused on multi-agent collaboration, reconfigurable systems, efficient perception and sensor fusion, distributed command and control, and task decomposition. In particular, this paper describes the main features and capabilities of our All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs), concentrating on their autonomous navigation capabilities.
