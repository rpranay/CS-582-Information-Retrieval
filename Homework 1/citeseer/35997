Forming Neural Networks through Efficient and Adaptive Coevolution This article demonstrates the advantages of a cooperative, coevolutionary search in difficult control problems. The SANE system coevolves a population of neurons that cooperate to form a functioning neural network. In this process, neurons assume different but overlapping roles, resulting in a robust encoding of control behavior. SANE is shown to be more efficient, more adaptive, and maintain higher levels of diversity than the more common network-based population approaches. Further empirical studies illustrate the emergent neuron specializations and the different roles the neurons assume in the population. 1 Introduction  Artificial evolution has become an increasingly popular method for forming control policies in difficult decision problems (Grefenstette, Ramsey, & Schultz, 1990; Moriarty & Miikkulainen, 1996a; Whitley, Dominic, Das, & Anderson, 1993). Such applications are very different from the function optimization tasks to which evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been tradition...
