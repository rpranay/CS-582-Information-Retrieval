The Diagnosis Frontend of the dlv System This paper presents the Diagnosis Frontend of dlv, which is a knowledge representation system under development at the Technische Universit??t Wien. The kernel language of the system is an extension of disjunctive logic programming (DLP) by integrity constraints; it offers frontends to several advanced knowledge representation formalisms. The formal model of diagnosis employed in the frontend includes both abductive diagnosis (over DLP theories) and consistency-based diagnosis. For each of the two diagnosis modalities, generic diagnoses, single error diagnoses, and subset minimal diagnoses are considered. We illustrate the use of the frontend by showing the dlv encodings of several diagnosis problems. Thereafter, we discuss implementation issues. Diagnostic reasoning is implemented on the dlv engine through suitable translations of diagnostic problems into disjunctive logic programs, such that their stable models correspond to diagnoses. For the six kinds of diagnostic reasoning problems emerging from above, such reductions are provided
