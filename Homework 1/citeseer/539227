EQUIP: a Software Platform for Distributed Interactive Systems EQUIP is a new software platform designed and engineered to support the development and deployment of distributed interactive systems, such as mixed reality user interfaces that combine distributed input and output devices to create a coordinated experience. EQUIP emphasises: cross-language development (currently C++ and Java), modularisation, extensibility, interactive performance, and heterogeneity of devices (from handheld devices to large servers and visualisation machines) and networks (including both wired and wireless technologies). A key element of EQUIP is its shared data service, which combines ideas from tuplespaces, general event systems and collaborative virtual environments. This data service provides a uniquely balanced treatment of state and event-based communication. It also supports distributed computation -- through remote class loading -- as well as passive data distribution. EQUIP has already been used in several projects within the EQUATOR Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) in the UK, and is freely available in source form (currently known to work on Windows, IRIX and MacOS-X platforms).
