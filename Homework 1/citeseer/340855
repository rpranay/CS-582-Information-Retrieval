Decomposition of Object-Oriented Database Schemas Based on F-logic, we specify an advanced data model with object-oriented and  logic-oriented features. For this model we study the decomposition of a class, the  counterpart to the well-known decomposition of a relation scheme under functional  dependencies. For this decomposition of a class, the transformation pivoting is  used. Pivoting transplants some attributes of the class to a newly generated class.  This new class is a subclass of the result class of the so-called pivot attribute. The  pivot attribute maintains the link between the original class and the new subclass.  We identify the conditions for the output of pivoting being equivalent with its  input. Additionally, we show under which conditions a schema with functional  dependencies can be recursively transformed into an equivalent one without nonkey  functional dependencies.  1 Introduction  The theory of database schema design aims at formally characterising \good" schemas and at inventing algorithms to measure and to im...
