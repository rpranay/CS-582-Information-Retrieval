Towards Active Logic Programming In this paper we present the new logic programming language DALI, aimed at defining agents and agent systems. A main design objective for DALI has been that of introducing in a declarative fashion all the essential features, while keeping the language as close as possible to the syntax and semantics of the plain Horn--clause language. Special atoms and rules have been introduced, for representing: external events, to which the agent is able to respond (reactivity); actions (reactivity and proactivity); internal events (previous conclusions which can trigger further activity); past and present events (to be aware of what has happened). An extended resolution is provided, so that a DALI agent is able to answer queries like in the plain Horn--clause language, but is also able to cope with the different kinds of events, and exhibit a (rational) reactive and proactive behaviour. 1 Introduction In this paper we address the issue of defining a logic programming language for reac...
