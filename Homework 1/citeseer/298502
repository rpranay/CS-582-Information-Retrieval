Scalable Information Organization We present three scalable extensions of the star algorithm for information organization that use  sampling. The star algorithm organizes a document collection into clusters that are naturally induced  by the topic structure of collection, via a computationally efficient cover by dense subgraphs. We  also provide supporting data from extensive experiments.  1 Introduction  Our goal is to develop a completely automated information organization system for digital libraries, automated tools for librarians to classify this information, automatic tools to create reference pointers into such collections, and automated tools that allow users to locate information effectively.  We focus on static and dynamic digital collections of unstructured text. We consider the problem of determining the topic structure of text data, without a priori knowledge of the number of topics in the data or any other information about their composition. We assume that the collections may be static (for example, digi...
