Towards a Network File System for Roaming Users Pervasive computing aims at offering access to user's data, anytime, anywhere, in a transparent manner. However, realizing such a vision necessitates several improvements in the way servers and user's terminals interact. Most notably, client terminals should not tightly rely on an information server which can be temporarily unavailable in a mobile situation. They should rather exploit all information servers available in a given context through loose coupling with both centralized servers and groups of terminals, in a serverless manner. In this position paper, we present the design rationale of a network file system that implements transparent adaptive file access according to the users' specific situations (e.g. device in use, network connectivity, etc).
