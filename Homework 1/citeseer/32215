This extended abstract focuses on teamwork and learning, two of the multiagent research challenges highlighted in RoboCup. To address the challenge of teamwork, we discuss the use of a domain-independent explicit model of teamwork, and an explicit representation of team plans and goals. We also discuss the application of agent learning in RoboCup. The vehicle for our research investigations in RoboCup is ISIS (ISI Synthetic),  a team of synthetic soccer-players that successfully participated in the simulation league of RoboCup'97, by win...
