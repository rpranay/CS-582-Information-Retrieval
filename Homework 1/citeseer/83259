A Description Logic with Transitive and Inverse Roles and Role Hierarchies transitive roles play an important r??le in the adequate representation of aggregated objects: they allow these objects to be described by referring to their parts without specifying a level of decomposition. In [Horrocks & Gough, 1997], the Description Logic (DL) ALCH R + is presented, which extends ALC with transitive roles and a role hierarchy. It is argued in [Sattler, 1998] that ALCH R + is well-suited to the representation of aggregated objects in applications that require various part-whole relations to be distinguished, some of which are transitive. For example, a medical knowledge base could contain the following entries defining two different parts of the brain, namely the gyrus and the cerebellum. In contrast to a gyrus, a cerebellum is an integral organ and, furthermore, a functional component of the brain. Hence the role is component (which is a non-transitive sub-role of is part) is used to describe the relation between the brain and the cerebellum: is component ??? is part gyrus:= (???consists.brain mass)  ??? (???is part.brain) cerebellum:= organ ??? (???is component.brain) However, ALCH R + does not allow the simultaneous description of parts by means of the whole to which they belong and of wholes by means of their constituent parts: one or other is possible, but not both. To overcome this limitation, we present the DL ALCHI R + which extends ALCH R + with inverse (converse) roles, allowing, for example, the use of has part as well as is part. 1 Using ALCHIR +, we can define a tumorous brain as: tumorous brain:= brain ??? (tumorous ??? (???has part.tumorous)) Part of this work was carried out while being a guest at IRST,
