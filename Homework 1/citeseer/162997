A Runtime System for Interactive Web Services Interactive web services are increasingly replacing traditional static web pages. Producing web services seems to require a tremendous amount of laborious lowlevel coding due to the primitive nature of CGI programming. We present ideas for an improved runtime system for interactive web services built on top of CGI running on virtually every combination of browser and HTTP/CGI server. The runtime system has been implemented and used extensively in <bigwig>, a tool for producing interactive web services.
