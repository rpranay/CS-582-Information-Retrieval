Appearance-Based Place Recognition for Topological Localization This paper presents a new appearance-based place recognition system for topological localization. The method uses a panoramic vision system to sense the environment. Color images are classified in real-time based on nearest-neighbor learning, image histogram matching, and a simple voting scheme. The system has been evaluated with eight cross-sequence tests in four unmodified environments, three indoors and one outdoors. In all eight cases, the system successfully tracked the mobile robot's position. The system correctly classified between 87% and 98% of the input color images. For the remaining images, the system was either momentarily confused or uncertain, but never classified an image incorrectly. 1. INTRODUCTION Localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics. Most mobile robots must be able to locate themselves in their environment in order to accomplish their tasks. Since mobile robot localization is a prerequisite for most applications, research has been very active i...
