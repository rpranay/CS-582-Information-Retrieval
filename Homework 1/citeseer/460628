Versus: A Temporal Web Repository Web data warehouses are useful for applications that need to process  large amounts of Web data in a short time. This paper presents  Versus, a Web repository model supporting object versioning and distributed  operation for this kind of applications. Versioning allows applications  to save the time dimension of data, enabling the development  of new Web applications. Distribution allows parallel operation over  massive amounts of data. We also present a prototype implementation  of Versus along with results collected from the analisys of the execution  of a distributed Web crawler simulator implemented as a Versus  application.  1
