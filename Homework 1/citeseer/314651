Management and Query Processing of one dimensional Intervals with the UB-Tree The management and query processing of one dimensional intervals is a special case of extended object handling. One dimensional intervals play an important role in temporal databases and they can also be used for fuzzy matching, fuzzy logic and measuring quality classes, etc. Most existing multidimensional access methods for extended objects do not address this special problem and most of them are main memory access methods that do not support e#cient access to secondary storage.  The research in the application of the UB-Tree to extended objects is part of my doctoral work. The contribution of this article is a specific solution for managing and querying one dimensional intervals with the UB-Tree, a multidimensional extension of the classical B-Tree. The combination of UB-Tree and transformation of extended objects to parameter space is an e#ective solution for this specific problem.  Keywords: one dimensional intervals, extended object handling, point query, range query, spatial data...
