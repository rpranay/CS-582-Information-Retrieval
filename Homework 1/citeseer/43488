A Survey of Proxy Cache Evaluation Techniques Proxy caches are increasingly used around the world to reduce bandwidth requirements and alleviate delays associated with the World-Wide Web. In order to compare proxy cache performances, objective measurements must be made. In this paper, we define a space of proxy evaluation methodologies based on source of workload used and form of algorithm implementation. We then survey recent publications and show their locations within this space. 1 Introduction  Proxy caches are increasingly used around the world to reduce bandwidth and alleviate delays associated with the World-Wide Web. This paper describes the space of proxy cache evaluation methodologies and places current research within that space. The primary contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) definition and description of the space of evaluation techniques; 2) appraisal of the di#erent methods within that space; and 3) a survey of cache evaluation techniques from the research literature. In the next section we provide backgro...
