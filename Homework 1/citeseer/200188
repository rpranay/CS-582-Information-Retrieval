Automatic Landmark Selection for Navigation with Panoramic Vision The use of visual landmarks for robot navigation is a promising field. It is apparent that the success of navigating by visual landmarks depends on the landmarks chosen. This paper reviews a monocular camera system proposed by [ Bianco and Zelinsky, 1999 ] which automatically selects landmarks and uses them for localisation and navigation tasks. The monocular system's landmark selection policy results in a limited area in which the robot can successfully localise itself. A new landmark navigation system which uses a panoramic vision system to overcome this restriction is proposed and the first steps taken in the development of the new system are reported. 1 Introduction  Visual navigation is one of the key problems in making successful autonomous robots. Vision as a sensor is the richest source of information about a mobile agents enviroment and as such contains information vital to solving navigation problems. One limit to visual navigation is the narrow field of view offered by norma...
