Co-X: Defining what Agents Do Together Discussions of agent interactions frequently characterize behavior  as Coherent, collaborative, cooperative, competitive, or   coordinated. We propose a series of formal distinctions among   these terms and several others. We argue that all of these are specializations  of the more foundational category of correlation,   which can be measured by the joint information of a system. We   also propose congruence as a category orthogonal to the others,  reflecting the degree to which correlation and its specializations   satisfy user requirements. Then we explore the degree to which   lack of correlation can arise purposefully, and show the need to   use formal stochasticity in cases where such lack of correlation is   truly necessary (such as in stochastic search).   Keywords   Coordination, correlation, competition, contention, cooperation,   congruence, communication, command, constraint, construction,   conversation, stigmergy, agent interaction   1.
