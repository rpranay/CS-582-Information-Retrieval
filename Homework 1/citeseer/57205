Improved Tracking of Multiple Humans with Trajectory Prediction and Occlusion Modeling A combined 2D, 3D approach is presented that allows for robust tracking of moving bodies in a given environment as observed via a single, uncalibrated video camera. Lowlevel features are often insufficient for detection, segmentation, and tracking of non-rigid moving objects. Therefore, an improved mechanism is proposed that combines lowlevel (image processing) and mid-level (recursive trajectory estimation) information obtained during the tracking process. The resulting system can segment and maintain the tracking of moving objects before, during, and after occlusion. At each frame, the system also extracts a stabilized coordinate frame of the moving objects. This stabilized frame can be used as input to motion recognition modules. The approach enables robust tracking without constraining the system to know the shape of the objects being tracked beforehand; although, some assumptions are made about the characteristics of the shape of the objects, and how they evolve with time.
