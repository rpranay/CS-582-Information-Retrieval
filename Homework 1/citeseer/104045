Guaranteeing No Interaction between Functional Dependencies and Tree-Like Inclusion Dependencies Functional dependencies (FDs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs) are the most fundamental integrity constraints that arise in practice in relational databases. A given set of FDs does not interact with a given set of INDs if logical implication of any FD can be determined solely by the given set of FDs, and logical implication of any IND can be determined solely by the given set of INDs. The set of tree-like INDs constitutes a useful subclass of INDs whose implication problem is polynomial time decidable. We exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of FDs and tree-like INDs not to interact; this condition can be tested in polynomial time. 1 Introduction  The implication problem for FDs and INDs is the problem of deciding for a given set \Sigma of FDs and INDs whether \Sigma logically implies oe, where oe is an FD or an IND. The implication problem is central in data dependency theory and is also utilised in the process of database design, since it can be used to test wheth...
