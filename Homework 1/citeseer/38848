An Agent-Based Approach for Manufacturing Integration - The CIIMPLEX Experience The production management system used by most manufacturers today is comprised of disconnected planning and execution processes, and lacks the support for interoperability and collaboration needed for enterprise-wide integration. This situation often prevents the manufacturer from fully exploring market opportunities in a timely fashion. To address this problem, we are exploring an agent-based approach to intelligent enterprise integration.
