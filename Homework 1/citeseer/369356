Object-Based Multimedia Content Description Schemes and Applications for MPEG-7 In this paper, we describe description schemes (DSs) for image, video, multimedia, home media, and archive content proposed to the MPEG-7 standard. MPEG-7 aims to create a multimedia content description standard in order to facilitate various multimedia searching and filtering applications. During the design process, special care was taken to provide simple but powerful structures that represent generic multimedia data. We use the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to illustrate and exemplify the proposed DSs because of its interoperability and flexibility advantages. The main components of the image, video, and multimedia description schemes are object, feature classification, object hierarchy, entity-relation graph, code downloading, multi-abstraction levels, and modality transcoding. The home media description instantiates the former DSs proposing the 6-W semantic features for objects, and 1-P physical and 6-W semantic object hierarchies. The archive description scheme aims to describ...
