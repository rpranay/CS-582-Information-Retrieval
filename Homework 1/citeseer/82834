Realising the Full Potential of Workflow Modelling: A Practical Perspective In a broad sense, a workflow provides a partial or complete automation of a process at a level above traditional implementation platforms. Much of the emphasis of workflow specifications, as deployed by workflow management systems, focuses on process execution semantics. This includes a process's pre- and post-conditions and the sequence, repetition, choice, parallelism and synchronisation which characterises inter-process triggering. The successful development of workflows requires not only this but, in general, a fuller conceptualisation  of a domain's processing, including process semantics. Given the diversity of business processing configurations, which in absence of a complete theoretical foundation, follow experience and intuition, the characterisations - indeed the cognition - of workflows still appears coarse. In this regard, a wellspring of modelling techniques, paradigms and informal-formal method extensions which address the analysis of organisational processing structures ...
