Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for Segmenting and Labeling Sequence Data We present conditional random elds, a framework  for building probabilistic models to segment  and label sequence data. Conditional random  fields offer several advantages over hidden  Markov models and stochastic grammars  for such tasks, including the ability to relax  strong independence assumptions made in those  models. Conditional random fields also avoid  a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy  Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative  Markov models based on directed graphical  models, which can be biased towards states  with few successor states. We present iterative  parameter estimation algorithms for conditional  random fields and compare the performance of  the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on  synthetic data.  1. Introduction  The need to segment and label sequences arises in many different problems in several scientific fields. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and stochastic grammars are well understood and widely used probabilistic models for such problems. I...
