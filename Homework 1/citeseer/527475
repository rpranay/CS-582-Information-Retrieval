Agent-Oriented Software Engineering ion: The process of defining a simplified model of the system that emphasises some of the details or properties, while suppressing others.  . Organisation  1  : The process of identifying and managing interrelationships between various problem solving components.  Next, the characteristics of complex systems need to be enumerated [8]:  . Complexity frequently takes the form of a hierarchy. That is, a system that is composed of inter-related sub-systems, each of which is in turn hierarchic in structure, until the lowest level of elementary sub-system is reached. The precise nature of these organisational relationships varies between sub-systems, however some generic forms (such as client-server, peer, team, etc.) can be identified. These relationships are not static: they often vary over time.  . The choice of which components in the system are primitive is relatively arbitrary and is defined by the observer's aims and objectives.  . Hierarchic systems evolve more quickly than non-hiera...
