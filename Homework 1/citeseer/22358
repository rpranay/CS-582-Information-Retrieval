Maintaining Temporal Views Over Non-Temporal Information Sources For Data Warehousing An important use of data warehousing is to provide temporal views over the history of source  data that may itself be non-temporal. While recent work in view maintenance is applicable to  data warehousing, only non-temporal views have been considered. In this paper, we introduce  a framework for maintaining temporal views over non-temporal information sources in a data  warehousing environment. We describe an architecture for the temporal data warehouse that  automatically maintains temporal views over non-temporal source relations, and allows users  to ask temporal queries using these views. Because of the dimension of time, a materialized  temporal view may need to be updated not only when source relations change, but also as time  advances. We present incremental techniques to maintain temporal views for both cases, and  outline the implementation of our approach in the WHIPS warehousing prototype at Stanford.  1 Introduction  A data warehouse is a repository for efficient querying ...
