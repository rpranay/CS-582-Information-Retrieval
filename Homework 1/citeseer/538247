Web Page Classification Using Spatial Information Extracting and processing information from web pages is an important  task in many areas like constructing search engines, information retrieval, and data  mining from the Web. Common approach in the extraction process is to represent a  page as a "bag of words" and then to perform additional processing on such a flat  representation. In this paper we propose a new, hierarchical representation that  includes browser screen coordinates for every HTML object in a page. Such spatial  information allows the definition of heuristics for recognition of common page  areas such as header, left and right menu, footer and center of a page. We show a  preliminary experiment where our heuristics are able to correctly recognize objects  in 73% of cases. Finally, we show that a Naive Bayes classifier, taking into account  the proposed representation, clearly outperforms the same classifier using only  information about the content of documents.
