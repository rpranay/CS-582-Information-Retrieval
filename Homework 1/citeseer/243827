Case-Based BDI Agents: an Effective Approach for Intelligent Search on the World Wide Web We present a simple randomized algorithm which solves linear programs with n constraints and d variables in expected minfO(d  2  2  d  n); e  2  p  d ln(n=  p  d )+O(  p  d+ln n)  g  time in the unit cost model (where we count the number of arithmetic operations on the numbers in the input); to be precise, the algorithm computes the lexicographically smallest nonnegative point satisfying n given linear inequalities in d variables. The expectation is over the internal randomizations    Work by the first author has been supported by a Humboldt Research Fellowship.
