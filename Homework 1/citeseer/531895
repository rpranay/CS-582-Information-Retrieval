An Architecture for Building Multi-Device Thin-Client Web User Interfaces We describe a new approach to providing adaptable thin client  interfaces for web-based information systems. Developers specify web-based  interfaces using a high-level mark-up language based on the logical structure of  the user interface. At run-time this single interface description is used to  automatically provide an interface for multiple web devices e.g. desk-top  HTML and mobile WML-based systems, as well as highlight, hide or disable  interface elements depending on the current user and user task. Our approach  allows developers to much more easily construct and maintain adaptable webbased  user interfaces than other current approaches.
