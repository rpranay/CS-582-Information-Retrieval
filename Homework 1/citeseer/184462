A Case-Based Reasoning Approach to Learning Control The paper describes an application of a case-based reasoning system TA3, to a control task in robotics. It differs from previous methods in its approach to relevancy-based retrieval, which allows for greater flexibility and for improved accuracy in performance. Most successful robotic manipulators are precise, fast, smooth and have high repeatability. Their major drawback is their tendency to have only a limited repertoire of movements that can only be extended by costly inverse kinematic calculations or direct teaching. Our approach also starts with a limited repertoire of movements, but can incrementally add new positions and thus allows for higher flexibility. The proposed architecture is experimentally evaluated on two real world domains, albeit simple, and the results are compared to other machine learning algorithms applied to the same problem.
