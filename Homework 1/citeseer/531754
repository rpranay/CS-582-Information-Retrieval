Prometheus: A Methodology for Developing Intelligent Agents Abstract. As agents gain acceptance as a technology there is a growing need for practical methods for developing agent applications. This paper presents the Prometheus methodology, which has been developed over several years in collaboration with Agent Oriented Software. The methodology has been taught at industry workshops and university courses. It has proven effective in assisting developers to design, document, and build agent systems. Prometheus differs from existing methodologies in that it is a detailed and complete (start to end) methodology for developing intelligent agents which has evolved out of industrial and pedagogical experience. This paper describes the process and the products of the methodology illustrated by a running example. 1
