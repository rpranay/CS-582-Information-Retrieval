Text Database Selection for Longer Queries A metasearch engine is a system that supports unified access to multiple local search engines. One of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine is to solve the database (search engine) selection problem, which is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query. For the database of each search engine, a representative which indicates approximately the contents of the database is created in advance to enable database selection. The representatives of all databases can be integrated into a single representative to make the selection process more scalable. While an integrated representative with high scalability has just been proposed and has been found to be effective for short queries, its effectiveness for longer queries is significantly lower. In the Internet environment, most queries initially submitted by users are short queries. However, it has been found that better search effectiveness can often be achieved when additional terms are added to the initial queries through query expansion or relevance feedback. The resulting queries are usually longer than the initial queries. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct database representatives and to decide which databases to select for longer queries. Experimental results are given to compare the performance of the new method with that of a previous method.
