Declarative Semantics Of Belief Queries In MLS Deductive Databases A logic based language, called MultiLog, for multi level secure relational databases has recently been proposed. It has been shown that MultiLog is capable of capturing the notion of user belief, of ltering unwanted and \useless" information in its proof theory. Additionally, it can guard against a previously unknown security breach { the so called surprise stories. In this paper, we outline a possible approach to a declarative characterization of belief queries in MultiLog in a very informal manner. We show that for \simple programs" with belief queries, the semantics is rather straight forward. Semantics for the general Horn programs may be developed based on the understanding of the model theoretic characterization of belief queries developed in this paper.  Keywords: Multi level security, belief queries, declarative semantics, completeness.  Introduction  In a recent research, Jukic and Vrbsky [8] demonstrate that users in the relational MLS model potentially have a cluttered view...
