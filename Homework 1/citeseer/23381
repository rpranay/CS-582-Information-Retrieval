The CMUnited-97 Robotic Soccer Team: Perception and Multiagent Control Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain which involves multiple  agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve  specificobjectives. In this paper, we describe CMUnited, the team of small  robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We  designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm,  and developed and implemented algorithms for strategic collaboration  between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots  can organize themselves in formations, hold specificroles, and pursue their  goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors  on multiple occasions. The robots can also switch roles to maximize  the overall performance of the team. We present an overview of the vision  processing algorithm which successfully tracks multiple moving objects and  predicts trajectories. The paper then focusses on the agent behaviors ranging  from low-level individual behaviors to coordinated, strategic team behaviors.
