Min-Wise Independent Permutations We define and study the notion of min-wise independent families of permutations. We say that  F #  S n is min-wise independent if for any set X  #  [n] and any x  #  X, when # is chosen at random in  F  we have Pr(min{#(X)} = #(x)) = 1  |X|  . In other words we require that all the elements of any fixed set X have an equal chance to become the minimum element of the image of X under #.  Our research was motivated by the fact that such a family (under some relaxations) is essential to the algorithm used in practice by the AltaVista web index software to detect and filter near-duplicate documents. However, in the course of our investigation we have discovered interesting and challenging theoretical questions related to this concept -- we present the solutions to some of them and we list the rest as open problems.  # Digital SRC, 130 Lytton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301, USA.
