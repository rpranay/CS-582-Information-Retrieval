A Machine Learning Approach to Building Domain-Specific Search Engines Domain-specific search engines are becoming  increasingly popular because they offer increased  accuracy and extra features not possible  with general, Web-wide search engines.  Unfortunately, they are also difficult and timeconsuming  to maintain. This paper proposes  the use of machine learning techniques to  greatly automate the creation and maintenance  of domain-specific search engines. We describe  new research in reinforcement learning, text  classification and information extraction that  enables efficient spidering, populates topic hierarchies,  and identifies informative text segments.  Using these techniques, we have built  a demonstration system: a search engine for  computer science research papers available at  www.cora.justresearch.com.  1 Introduction  As the amount of information on the World Wide Web grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to find just what wewant. While general-purpose search engines suchas  AltaVista and HotBot offer high coverage, they often provi...
