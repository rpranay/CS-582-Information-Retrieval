Evaluation of Item-Based Top-N Recommendation Algorithms The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of  recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of N items that will  be of interest to a certain user. User-based Collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building  recommender systems to date, and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the  computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers that in typical commercial  applications can grow to be several millions. To address these scalability concerns item-based recommendation  techniques have been developed that analyze the user-item matrix to identify relations between the different items,  and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.  In this paper we present one such class of item-based recommendation algorithms that first determine the similarities  between the various ite...
