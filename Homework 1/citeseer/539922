ARQuake: An Outdoor/Indoor Augmented Reality First Person Application This pap er presents an outdoor/indoor augmented re- ality first person applic ationAR(2uake we have developal. ARQuake is an extension of the desktop game Quake, and as such we are investigating how to convert a desktop first person application into an outdoor/indoor mobile augmented reality application. We present an archire  cture for a low cost, moderately accurate six degrees of freedom tracking system based on GP$, digital compass, and fiducial vision-based tracking. Usability issues  such as monster selection, colour, and input devies are  discussed. A second application for AR architectural design visualisation is presented.
