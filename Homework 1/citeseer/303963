Towards Automating the Evolution of Linguistic Competence in Artificial Agents The goal of this research is to understand and automate the mechanisms by which language can emerge among artificial, knowledge-based and rational agents. We use the paradigm of rationality defined by decision theory, and employ the formal model of negotiation studied in game theory to allow the emergence and enrichment of an agent communication language. 1 Introduction The aim of our research is to understand and automate the mechanisms by which language can emerge among artificial, knowledge-based and rational agents. Our ultimate goal is to be able to design and implement agents that, upon encountering other agent(s) with which they do not share an agent communication language, are able to initiate creation of, and further able to evolve and enrich, a mutually understandable agent communication language (ACL). This paper outlines the overall approach we are taking, and identifies some of the basic concepts and tools that we think are necessary to accomplish our goal. First, the a...
