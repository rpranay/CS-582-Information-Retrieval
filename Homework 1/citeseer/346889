Yarrow: A Real-Time Client Side Meta-Search Learner In this paper we report our research on building Yarrow - an intelligent web meta-search engine. The predominant feature of Yarrow is that in contrast to the lack of adaptive learning features in existing metasearch engines, Yarrow is equipped with a practically efficient on-line learning algorithm so that it is capable of helping the user to search for the desired documents with as little feedback as possible. Currently, Yarrow can query eight of the most popular search engines and is able to perform document parsing and indexing, and learning in real-time on client side. Its architecture and performance are also discussed. 1.
