Query Processing for Moving Objects with Space-Time Grid Storage Model With growing popularity of mobile computing devices and wireless communications, managing dynamically changing information about moving objects is becoming feasible. In this paper, we implement a system that manages such information and propose two new algorithms. One is an efficient range query algorithm with a ltering step which efficiently determines if a polyline corresponding to the trajectory of a moving object intersects with a given range. The other is a nearest neighbor query algorithm. We study the performance of the system, which shows that despite the filtering step, for moderately large ranges, the range query algorithm we propose outperforms the algorithm without filtering.
