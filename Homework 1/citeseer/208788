Improving the search on the Internet by using WordNet and lexical operators A vast amount of information is available on the Internet, and naturally,  many information gathering tools have been developed. Search engines with  dijerent characteristics, such as Alta Vista, Lycos, Infoseek, and others are  available. However, there are inherent difficulties associated with the task of  retrieving information on the Internet: (1) the web information is diverse and  highly unstructured, (2) the size of information is large and it grows at an  exponential rate. While these two issues are profound and require long term  solutions, still it is possible to develop software around the search engines to  improve the quality of the information retrieved. In this paper we present a  natural language interface system to a search engine. The search improvement  achieved by our system is based on: (1) a query extension using WordNet and  (2) the use of new lexical operators that replace the classical boolean opera-  tors used by current search engines. Several tests have been performed using  the TIPSTER topics collection, provided at the 6lb Text Retrieval Conference  (TREC-6); the results obtained are presented and discussed.
