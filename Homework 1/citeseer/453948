Determining When to Use an Agent-Oriented Software Engineering Paradigm . With the emergence of agent-oriented software engineering  techniques, software engineers have a new way of conceptualizing complex  distributed software requirements. To help determine the most appropriate  software engineering methodology, a set of defining criteria is required. In this  paper, we describe out approach to determining these criteria, as well as a  technique to assist software engineers with the selection of a software  engineering methodology based on those criteria.  1
