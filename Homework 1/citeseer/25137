Generating, Executing and Revising Schedules for Autonomous Robot Office Couriers Scheduling the tasks of an autonomous robot office courier and carrying out the scheduled tasks reliably and efficiently pose challenging problems for autonomous robot control. To carry out their jobs reliably and efficiently many autonomous mobile service robots acting in human working environments have to view their jobs as everyday activity: they should accomplish longterm efficiency rather than optimize problem-solving episodes. They should also exploit opportunities and avoid problems flexibly because often robots are forced to generate schedules based on partial information. We propose to implement the controller for scheduled activity by employing concurrent reactive plans that reschedule the course of action whenever necessary and while performing their actions. The plans are represented modularly and transparently to allow for easy transformation. Scheduling and schedule repair methods are implemented as plan transformation rules. Introduction  To carry out their jobs reliably...
