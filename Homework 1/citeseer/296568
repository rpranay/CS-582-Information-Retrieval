Combining Multiple Learning Strategies for Effective Cross Validation Parameter tuning through cross-validation  becomes very difficult when the validation  set contains no or only a few examples of  the classes in the evaluation set. We address  this open challenge by using a combination  of classifiers with different performance  characteristics to effectively reduce the performance  variance on average of the overall  system across all classes, including those  not seen before. This approach allows us to  tune the combination system on available but  less-representative validation data and obtain  smaller performance degradation of this  system on the evaluation data than using a  single-method classifier alone. We tested this  approach by applying k-Nearest Neighbor,  Rocchio and Language Modeling classifiers  and their combination to the event tracking  problem in the Topic Detection and Tracking  (TDT) domain, where new classes (events)  are created constantly over time, and representative  validation sets for new classes are  often difficult to ob...
