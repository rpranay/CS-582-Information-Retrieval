About Knowledge Discovery in Texts: A Definition and an Example This paper claims that Knowledge Discovery in texts (KDT) is a new scientific topic, stemming from Knowledge Discovery in DataBases (KDD), both of them relying on a rather specific definition of what "knowledge" is (it has to be, as it is often said, understandable and useful, and even surprising). We shall rapidly explore this definition of knowledge, and apply it to a definition of what KDT is. We shall then illustrate on a detailed example what kind of new results KDT can bring, showing their interest and that they have little to do with the results of the long existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field.
