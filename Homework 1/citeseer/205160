Analysis on a Mobile Agent Based Algorithm for Network Management Recent advance in the agent technology has brought in a new method for network routing, the ant routing algorithm. Although its effectiveness and efficiency have been demonstrated and reported in the literature, its properties have not yet been well studied. This paper will present some preliminary analysis of this algorithm in regard to its population growing property and jumping behavior. For both synchronized and asynchronized networks, we have shown that the expected number of agents in a node is no more than  (1 +max i  fj\Omega  i jg)km, where  j\Omega  i j is the number of neighbor hosts of the i  th  host; k is the number of agents generated per request and m is the average number of requests. It is shown that under a mild condition, for all p  (1 + max i  fj\Omega  i jg)km, the probability of the number of agents in a node exceeding p is less than  R 1  p  P(x)dx; where P(x) is a normal distributed function with mean and variance given by (1+max i  fj\Omega  i jg)km  and  (km)...
