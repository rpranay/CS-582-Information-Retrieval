Providing an Embedded Software Environment for Wireless PDAs . The use of wireless Pdas is foreseen to outrun the one of Pcs in the near future. However, for this to actually happen, adequate software environments must be devised in order to allow the execution of various types of applications. This paper introduces the base features of such an environment, which is a customizable Jvm-based middleware. In particular, the middleware platform embeds services for appropriate resource management and for supporting novel Pda-oriented applications.  1 Introduction  The use of wireless Personal Digital Assistant (Pda) devices is foreseen to outrun the one of Pcs in the near future. However, for this to actually happen, there is still the need to devise adequate software and hardware platforms. The use of Pdas should be as convenient as the one of Pcs and in particular must not overly restrict the applications that are supported. Considering the ongoing effort towards providing convenient hardware platforms in industry, this paper focuses on design issu...
