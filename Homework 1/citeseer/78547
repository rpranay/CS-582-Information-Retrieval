Visual Information Retrieval from Large Distributed On-line Repositories ion ---  VIR systems differ in the level of abstraction in  which content is indexed. For example,  images may be indexed at various levels, such  as at the feature-level (e.g., color, texture, and  shape), object-level (e.g., moving foreground  object), syntax-level (e.g., video shot), and  semantic-level (e.g., image subject), and so  forth. Most automatic VIR systems aim at lowlevel features, while the high-level indexes are  usually generated manually. Interaction  among different levels is an exciting but  unsolved issue.  . Generality ---  VIR systems differ in their specificity of the  domain of visual information. For example,  customized feature sets can be developed to  incorporate specific domain knowledge, such  as those in medical and remote-sensing  applications. Other, more general VIR  systems aim at indexing unconstrained visual  information such as that on the Internet.  . Content Collection ---  VIR systems differ in the methods in which new  visual information is ad...
