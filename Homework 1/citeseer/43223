View-based Interpretation of Real-time Optical Flow for Gesture Recognition We have developed a real-time, view-based gesture recognition system. Optical flow is estimated and segmented into motion blobs. Gestures are recognized using a rule-based technique based on characteristics of the motion blobs such as relative motion and size. Parameters of the gesture (e.g., frequency) are then estimated using context specific techniques. The system has been applied to create an interactive environment for children. 1 Introduction  For many applications, the use of hand and body gestures is an attractive alternative to the cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction. This is especially true for interacting in virtual reality environments, where the user is no longer confined to the desktop and should be able to move around freely. While special devices can be worn to achieve these goals, these can be expensive and unwieldy. There has been a recent surge in computer vision research to provide a solution that doesn't use such devices. This paper describe...
