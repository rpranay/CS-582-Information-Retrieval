Optimizing Large Join Queries in Mediation Systems In data integration systems, queries posed to a mediator need to be translated into a sequence of queries to the underlying data sources. In a heterogeneous environment, with sources of diverse and limited query capabilities, not all the translations are feasible. In this paper, we study the problem of finding feasible and efficient query plans for mediator systems. We consider conjunctive queries on mediators and model the source capabilities through attribute-binding adornments. We use a simple cost model that focuses on the major costs in mediation systems, those involved with sending queries to sources and getting answers back. Under this metric, we develop two algorithms for source query sequencing -- one based on a simple greedy strategy and another based on a partitioning scheme. The first algorithm produces optimal plans in some scenarios, and we show a linear bound on its worst case performance when it misses optimal plans. The second algorithm generates optimal plans in more scenarios, while having no bound on the margin by which it misses the optimal plans. We also report on the results of the experiments that study the performance of the two algorithms.
