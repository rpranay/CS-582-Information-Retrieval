Interaction between Path and Type Constraints XML [7], which is emerging as an important standard for data exchange on the World-Wide Web, highlights the importance of semistructured data. Although the XML standard itself does not require any schema or type system, a number of proposals [6, 17, 19] have been developed that roughly correspond to data definition languages. These allow one to constrain the structure of XML data by imposing a schema on it. These and other proposals also advocate the need for integrity constraints, another form of constraints that should, for example, be capable of expressing inclusion constraints and inverse relationships. The latter have recently been studied as path constraints in the context of semistructured data [4, 9]. It is likely that future XML proposals will involve both forms of constraints, and it is therefore appropriate to understand the interaction between them. This paper investigates that interaction. In particular it studies constraint implication problems, which are important both i...
