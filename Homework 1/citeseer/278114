Extending Classical Logic with Inductive Definitions The goal of this paper is to extend classical logic with  a generalized notion of inductive definition supporting  positive and negative induction, to investigate the  properties of this logic, its relationships to other logics  in the area of non-monotonic reasoning, logic programming  and deductive databases, and to show its application  for knowledge representation by giving a typology  of definitional knowledge.
