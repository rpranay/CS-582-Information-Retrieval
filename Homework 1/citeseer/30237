Non-Supervised Sensory-Motor Agents Learning This text discusses a proposal for creation and destruction of neurons based on the sensory-motor activity. This model, called sensory-motor schema, is used to define a sensory-motor agent as a collection of activity schemata. The activity schema permits a useful distribution of neurons in a conceptual space, creating concepts based on action and sensation. Such approach is inspired in the theory of the Swiss psychologist and epistemologist Jean Piaget, and intends to make explicit the account of the processes of continuous interaction between sensory-motor agents and their environments when agents are producing cognitive structures. 1. Introduction  The notion of an autonomous agent plays a central role in contemporaneous research on Artificial Intelligence [3]. Cognitive agents are based on symbolic processing mechanisms. Reactive agents are based on alternative computational mechanisms like neural networks, analogic processing, etc. The alternative approach using autonomous agents b...
