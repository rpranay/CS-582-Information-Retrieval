Generating Code for Agent UML Sequence Diagrams For several years, a new category of description techniques  exists: Agent UML [10] which is based on UML. Agent UML is an extension  of UML to tackle dierences between agents and objects. Since  this description technique is rather new, it does not supply tools or algorithms  for protocol synthesis. Protocol synthesis corresponds to generate  code for a formal description of a protocol. The derived program behaves  like the formal description. This work presents rst elements to help designers  generating code for Agent UML sequence diagrams. The protocol  synthesis is applied to the example of English Auction protocol.
