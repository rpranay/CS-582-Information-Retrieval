The Abels Framework For Linking Distributed Simulations Using Software Agents Many simulations need access to dynamicallychanging data from other sources such as sensors or even other simulations. For example, a forest fire simulation may need data from sensors in the forest and a weather simulation at a remote site. We have developed an agentbased software framework to facilitate the dynamic exchange of data between distributed simulations and other remote data resources. The framework, called ABELS (Agent-Based Environment for Linking Simulations), allows independently designed simulations to communicate seamlessly with no a priori knowledge of the details of other simulations and data resources. This paper discusses our architecture and current implementation using Sun Microsystems' Jini technology and the D'Agents mobile agent system. This paper extends earlier work by describing the implementation of the brokering system for matching data producers and consumers and providing additional details of other components.
