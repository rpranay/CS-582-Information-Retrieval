MRML: An Extensible Communication Protocol for Interoperability and Benchmarking of Multimedia Information Retrieval Systems While in the area of relational databases interoperability is ensured by common communication protocols (e.g. ODBC/JDBC using SQL), Content Based Image Retrieval Systems (CBIRS) and other multimedia retrieval systems are lacking both a common query language and a common communication protocol.  Besides its obvious short term convenience, interoperability of systems is crucial for the exchange and analysis of user data. In this paper, we present and describe an extensible XML-based query markup language, called MRML (Multimedia Retrieval Markup Language). MRML is primarily designed so as to ensure interoperability between dierent content{based multimedia retrieval systems. Further, MRML allows researchers to preserve their freedom in extending their system as needed.  MRML encapsulates multimedia queries in a way that enables multimedia (MM) query languages, MM content descriptions, MM query engines, and MM user interfaces to grow independently from each other, reaching a maximum of in...
