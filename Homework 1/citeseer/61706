Integrated Document Caching and Prefetching in Storage Hierarchies Based on Markov-Chain Predictions .<F3.733e+05> Large multimedia document archives may hold a major fraction of their data in tertiary storage libraries for cost reasons. This paper develops an integrated approach to the vertical data migration between the tertiary, secondary, and primary storage in that it reconciles speculative prefetching, to mask the high latency of the tertiary storage, with the replacement policy of the document caches at the secondary and primary storage level, and also considers the interaction of these policies with the tertiary and secondary storage request scheduling. The integrated migration policy is based on a continuoustime Markov chain model for predicting the expected number of accesses to a document within a specified time horizon. Prefetching is initiated only if that expectation is higher than those of the documents that need to be dropped from secondary storage to free up the necessary space. In addition, the possible resource contention at the tertiary and secondary storage is tak...
