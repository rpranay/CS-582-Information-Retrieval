How to Avoid Building DataBlades That Know the Value of Everything and the Cost of Nothing The object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) offers many potential benefits for scientific, multimedia and financial applications. However, work remains in the integration of domain-specific class libraries (data cartridges, extenders, DataBlades  ??  ) into ORDBMS query processing. A major problem is that the standard mechanisms for query selectivity estimation, taken from relational database systems, rely on properties specific to the standard data types; creation of new mechanisms remains extremely difficult because the software interfaces provided by vendors are relatively low-level. In this paper, we discuss extensions of the generalized search tree, or GiST, to support a higher-level but less type-specific approach. Specifically, we discuss the computation of selectivity estimates with confidence intervals using a variety of index-based approaches and present results from an experimental comparison of these methods with several estimators from the literature. 1.
