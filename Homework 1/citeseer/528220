Efficient Web Search on Mobile Devices with Multi-Modal Input and Intelligent Text Summarization Ease of browsing and searching for information on mobile devices has been an area of increasing interest in the World Wide Web research community [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]. While some work has been done to enhance the usability of handwriting recognition to input queries through techniques such as automatic word suggestion [2], the use of speech as an input mechanism has not been extensively studied. This paper presents a system which combines spoken query in addition to automatic title summarization to ease searching for information on a mobile device. Preliminary usability study with 10 subjects indicates that spoken queries is preferred over other input methods.
