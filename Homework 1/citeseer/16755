Case-based Learning for Knowledge-based Design Support . We present a general approach to combine methods of interactive knowledge acquisition with methods for machine learning. The approach has been developed in order to deliver knowledge required by support-systems for design-tasks. Learning rests upon a knowledge representation scheme for cases that distinguishes between knowledge needed for subgoaling and knowledge needed for design. We employ traces, i.e., protocols of the user's actions when tackling design-tasks as the initial input for incremental knowledge acquisition. This allows to learn task structures to be used for subgoaling and case-bases plus similarity relations applicable to particular case-bases. 1 INTRODUCTION Integrating incremental learning into a knowledge-based systems seems to be a promising way to lessen the burden of knowledge elicitation to system development [9]. The goal of this paper is to point out how learning can be used in an interactive design-support system that uses Cbr [8] as the main problem solvin...
