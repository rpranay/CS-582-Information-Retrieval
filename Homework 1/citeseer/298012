Scalable Maintenance in Distributed Data Warehousing Environment The maintenance of data warehouses is becoming an increasingly important topic due to the growing  use, derivation and integration of digital information. Most previous work has dealt with one centralized  data warehouse (DW) only. In this paper, we now focus on environments with multiple data warehouses  that are possibly derived from other data warehouses. In such a large-scale environment, data  updates from base sources may arrive in individual data warehouses in different orders, thus resulting  in inconsistent data warehouse extents. We propose a registry-based solution strategy that addresses  this problem by employing a registry agent responsible for establishing one unique order for the propagation  of updates from the base sources to the data warehouses. With this solution, individual data  warehouse managers can still maintain their respective extents autonomously and independently from  each other, thus allowing them to apply any of the existing incremental maintenance algo...
