Query Optimization for Semistructured Data using Path Constraints in a Deterministic Data Model . Path constraints have been studied for semistructured data  modeled as a rooted edge-labeled directed graph [4, 11--13]. In this model,  the implication problems associated with many natural path constraints  are undecidable [11, 13]. A variant of the graph model, called the deterministic  data model , was recently proposed in [10]. In this model, data is  represented as a graph with deterministic edge relations, i.e., the edges  emanating from any node in the graph have distinct labels. This model is  more appropriate for representing, e.g., ACeDB [27] databases and Web  sites. This paper investigates path constraints for the deterministic data  model. It demonstrates the application of path constraints to, among  others, query optimization. Three classes of path constraints are considered:  the language Pc introduced in [11], an extension of Pc , denoted by  P  w  c , by including wildcards in path expressions, and a generalization of  P  w  c , denoted by P  c , by representing pa...
