OMS Java: Lessons Learned from Building a Multi-Tier Object Management Framework We present the object-oriented multi-tier application framework OMS Java which is  independent of the underlying database management system (DBMS). We detail the storage  management component and sketch which part of the framework has to be extended when  introducing a new DBMS. We compare versions of OMS Java using the persistent storage  engine ObjectStore PSE Pro for Java, the object-oriented DBMS Objectivity/DB, the objectrelational  DBMS Oracle and the proprietary DBMS Berkley DB.  1 Introduction  Most applications create data that extends the life of an application process making it necessary that application objects can be stored in and retrieved from non-volatile storage. Furthermore, looking at pure object-oriented applications, i.e. applications developed entirely using an objectoriented language environment such as Java [KA96], application objects typically refer to many other application objects resulting in complex object hierarchies. It is therefore crucial to find mechan...
