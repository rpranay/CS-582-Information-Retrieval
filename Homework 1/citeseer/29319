Optimising Propositional Modal Satisfiability for Description Logic Subsumption . Effective optimisation techniques can make a dramatic difference in the performance of knowledge representation systems based on expressive description logics. Because of the correspondence between description logics and propositional modal logic many of these techniques carry over into propositional modal logic satisfiability checking. Currently-implemented representation systems that employ these techniques, such as FaCT and DLP, make effective satisfiable checkers for various propositional modal logics. 1 Introduction  Description logics are a logical formalism for the representation of knowledge about individuals and descriptions of individuals. Description logics represent and reason with descriptions similar to "all people whose friends are both doctors and lawyers" or "all people whose children are doctors or lawyers or who have a child who has a spouse". The computations performed by systems that implement description logics are based around determining whether one descriptio...
