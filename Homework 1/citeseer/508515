Measuring Knowledge with Workflow Management Systems Expert knowledge is captured in the process design. In organisations knowledge becomes embedded in routines, processes, practices as well as norms and can be evaluated by decisions or actions to which it leads, for example measurable efficiencies, speed or quality gains. Knowledge develops over time, through experience that includes what we absorb from courses, books, and mentors as well as informal learning. In this paper we analyse workflow history and demonstrate that workflow management systems enable knowledge measurement. 1
