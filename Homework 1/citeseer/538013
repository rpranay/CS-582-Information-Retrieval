Self-Organization in Ad Hoc Sensor Networks: An Empirical Study Research in classifying and recognizing complex concepts  has been directing its focus increasingly on distributed  sensing using a large amount of sensors. The colossal  amount of sensor data often obstructs traditional algorithms  in centralized approaches, where all sensor data is directed  to one central location to be processed. Spreading the  processing of sensor data over the network seems to be a  promising option, but distributed algorithms are harder to  inspect and evaluate. Using self-sufficient sensor boards  with short-range wireless communication capabilities, we  are exploring approaches to achieve an emerging  distributed perception of the sensed environment in realtime  through clustering. Experiments in both simulation  and real-world platforms indicate that this is a valid  methodology, being especially promising for computation  on many units with limited resources.
