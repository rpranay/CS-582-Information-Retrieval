Machine Learning based User Modeling for WWW Search The World Wide Web (Www) offers a huge number of documents which deal with information concerning nearly any topic. Thus, search engines and meta search engines currently are the key to finding information. Search engines with crawler based indexes vary in recall and offer a very bad precision. Meta search engines try to overcome these lacks by simple methods for information extraction, information filtering and integration of heterogenous information resources. Only few search engines employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. Recently, user modeling techniques have become more and more popular since they proved to be a useful means for user centered information filtering and presentation. Many personal agent based system for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of machine learning based user modeling (see [17]) methods into web search services. We propose an abstract prototype which is being developed at the Uni...
