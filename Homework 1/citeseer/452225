Abstractions and Infrastructures for the Design and Development of Mobile Agent Organizations Internet applications can take advantage of a paradigm based on  autonomous and mobile agents. However, suitable abstractions  and infrastructures are required for the effective engineering of  such applications. In this paper, we argue that a conceptual  framework for context-dependent coordination, supported by an  infrastructure based on programmable media, can promote a  modular and easy to manage approach to the design and  development of mobile agent applications in terms of  computational organizations. The MARS coordination  infrastructure is presented as an implementation of a  coordination infrastructure promoting context-dependent  coordination. A case study in the area of workflow management is  introduced to clarify the concepts presented.  Keywords: Mobile Agents, Agent Organizations, Coordination  Infrastructures, Agent-oriented Software Engineering.  1
