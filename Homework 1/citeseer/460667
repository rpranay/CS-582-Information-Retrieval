Hardware/Software Implementation for Localization and Classification Systems Pattern localization and classification are CPU time intensive being normally implemented in software, however with lower performance than custom implementations. Custom implementation in hardware (ASIC) allows real-time processing, having higher cost and time-to-market than software implementation. We present an alternative that represents a good trade-off between performance and cost. This paper presents initially some systems dealing with object localization and classification, analyzing the performance and implementation of each work. After we propose a system for localization and classification of shapes using reconfigurable devices (FPGA) and a signal processor (DSP) available in a flexible codesign platform. The system will be described using C and VHDL languages, for the software and hardware parts respectively, and has been implemented in an APTIX prototyping platform.  1.
