Simultaneous Proxy Evaluation The Simultaneous Proxy Evaluation (SPE) architecture is designed to evaluate multiple web proxies in parallel using object requests which are duplicated and passed to each proxy. The SPE architecture reduces problems of unrealistic test environments, dated and/or inappropriate workloads, and is additionally applicable to contentbased prefetching proxies. It is intended to measure byte and object hit rates, client-perceived latencies, and cache consistency. We characterize a space of proxy evaluation methodologies and place this architecture within it. 1 Introduction This paper presents a new architecture for the evaluation of proxy caches. Initially, it grew out of research in techniques for prefetching in web caches. In particular, we found that existing mechanisms for the evaluation of proxy caches were not well suited to prefetching systems. Objective evaluation is paramount to all research, whether applied or academic. Since this is certainly relevant when exploring various approac...
