Mixed Initiative in Interactions between Software Agents We have been working during the past several years on techniques for modeling the way that software agents can take and release the initiative while interacting together. We are interested in building multiagent systems composed of software agents that can interact with human users in sophisticated ways which are analogous to human conversations. In this paper, we describe two projects we have worked on: a multiagent approach for simulating conversations between software agents, and the Virtual Theater. 1. Introduction  The need for software agents that assist users in achieving various tasks, collaborate with them, entertain them, or even act on their behalf is getting greater. Software agents are computer systems that exploit their own knowledge bases, have their own goals and their own capabilities, perform actions, and interact with other agents as well as with people. Autonomy is an essential characteristic of such agents, which they express when they take the initiative. Agents t...
