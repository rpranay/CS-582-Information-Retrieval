Knowledge-based Wrapper Generation by Using XML Information extraction is the process of recognizing  the particular fragments of a document that constitute  its core semantic content. However, most  previous information extraction systems were not  effective for real-world information sources due to  difficulties in acquiring and representing useful domain  knowledge and in dealing with structural heterogeneity  inherent in different sources.  In order to resolve these problems, this paper  proposes a scheme of knowledge-based wrapper  generation for semi-structured and labeled documents.  The implementation of an agent-oriented information  extraction system, XTROS, is described.  In contrast with previous wrapper learning agents,  XTROS represents both the domain knowledge and  the wrappers by XML documents to increase modularity,  flexibility, and interoperability among multiple  parties. XTROS also facilitates simpler implementation  of the wrapper generator by exploiting  XML parsers and interpreters. XTROS shows  good performance on several Web sites in the domain  of real estates, and it is expected to be easily  adaptable to different domains by plugging in appropriate  XML-based domain knowledge.  1
