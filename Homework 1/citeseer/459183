Estimating the Orientation and Recovery of Text Planes in a Single Image A method for the fronto-parallel recovery of paragraphs of text under full  perspective transformation is presented. The horizontal vanishing point of the  text plane is found using an extension of 2D projection profiles. This allows  the accurate segmentation of the lines of text. Analysis of the lines will then  reveal the style of justification of the paragraph, and provide an estimate of  the vertical vanishing point of the plane. The text is finally recovered to a  fronto-parallel view suitable for OCR or other higher-level recognition.
