Point-based Temporal Extensions of SQL and their Efficient Implementation . This chapter introduces a new approach to temporal extensions of SQL. The main difference from most of the current proposals is the use single time points, rather than intervals or various other complexvalues for references to time, while still achieving efficient query evaluation. The proposed language, SQL/TP, extends the syntax of SQL/92 to handle temporal data in a natural way: it adds a single data type to represent a linearly ordered universe of time instants. The semantics of the new language naturally extends the standard SQL semantics and eliminates or fixes many of the problems connected with defining a precise semantics to temporal query languages based on explicit interval-valued temporal attributes. The efficient query evaluation procedure is based on a compilation technique that translates SQL/TP queries to SQL/92. Therefore existing off-shelf database systems can be used as back-ends for implementations based on this approach to manage temporal data. 1 Why another temp...
