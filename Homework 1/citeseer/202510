Embodied Evolution: A Response to Challenges in Evolutionary Robotics We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE), a new methodology for conducting evolutionary robotics (ER). Embodied evolution uses a population of physical robots that evolve by reproducing with one another in the task environment. EE addresses several issues identified by researchers in the evolutionary robotics community as problematic for the development of ER. We review results from our first experiments and discuss the advantages and limitations of the EE methodology.
