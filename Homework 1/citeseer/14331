Point- Versus Interval-based Temporal Data Models The association of timestamps with various data items such as tuples or attribute values is fundamental to the management of time-varying information. Using intervals in timestamps, as do most data models, leaves a data model with a variety of choices for giving a meaning to timestamps. Specifically, some such data models claim to be point-based while other data models claim to be interval-based. The meaning chosen for timestamps is important---it has a pervasive effect on most aspects of a data model, including database design, a variety of query language properties, and query processing techniques, e.g., the availability of query optimization opportunities. This paper precisely defines the notions of point-based and interval-based temporal data models, thus providing a new, formal basis for characterizing temporal data models and obtaining new insights into the properties of their query languages. Queries in point-based models treat snapshot equivalent argument relations identically....
