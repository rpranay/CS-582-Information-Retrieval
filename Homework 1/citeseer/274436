Collision Avoidance and Resolution Multiple Access for Multichannel Wireless Networks The CARMA-NTG protocol is presented and analyzed. CARMA-NTG dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for the right to be added to the group of stations allowed to transmit data without collisions; this is done using a collision resolution splitting algorithm based on a request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) message exchange with non-persistent carrier sensing. CARMA-NTG ensures that one station is added to the group transmission period if one or more stations send requests to be added in the previous contention period. The group-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the group by successfully completing an RTS/CTS message exchange in previous contention periods. As long as a station maintains its position in the group, it is able to transmit data packets without collision. An upper bound is derived for the average costs of obtaining the first success in the splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. These results indicate that collision resolution is a powerful mechanism in combination with floor acquisition and group allocation multiple access. 1
