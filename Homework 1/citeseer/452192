The Role of Information Extraction for Textual CBR Abstract. The benefits of CBR methods in domains where cases are text depend on the underlying text representation. Today, most TCBR approaches are limited to the degree that they are based on efficient, but weak IR methods. These do not allow for reasoning about the similarities between cases, which is mandatory for many CBR tasks beyond text retrieval, including adaptation or argumentation. In order to carry out more advanced CBR that compares complex cases in terms of abstract indexes, NLP methods are required to derive a better case representation. This paper discusses how state-of-the-art NLP/IE methods might be used for automatically extracting relevant factual information, preserving information captured in text structure and ascertaining negation. It also presents our ongoing research on automatically deriving abstract indexing concepts from legal case texts. We report progress toward integrating IE techniques and ML for generalizing from case texts to our CBR case representation. 1
