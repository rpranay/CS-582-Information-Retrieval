The Cooperative Problem-Solving Process We present a model of cooperative problem solving that describes the process from its beginning, with some agent recognizing the potential for cooperation with respect to one of its goals, through to team action. Our approach is to characterize the mental states of the agents that lead them to solicit, and take part in, cooperative action. The model is formalized by expressing it as a theory in a quantified multi-modal logic.  Keywords: Multi-agent systems, cooperation, modal logic, temporal logic.  1 Introduction  Agents --- both human and artificial --- can engage in many and varied types of social interaction, ranging from altruistic cooperation through to open conflict. However, perhaps the paradigm example of social interaction is cooperative problem solving (CPS), in which a group of autonomous agents choose to work together to achieve a common goal. For example, we might find a group of people working together to move a heavy object, play a symphony, build a house, or write a jo...
