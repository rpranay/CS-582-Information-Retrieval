Learning to Catch: Applying Nearest Neighbor Algorithms to Dynamic Control Tasks Steven L. Salzberg  1  and David W. Aha  2 1 Introduction  Dynamic control problems are the subject of much research in machine learning (e.g., Selfridge, Sutton, & Barto, 1985; Sammut, 1990; Sutton, 1990). Some of these studies investigated the applicability of various k-nearest neighbor methods (Dasarathy, 1990) to solve these tasks by modifying control strategies based on previously gained experience (e.g., Connell & Utgoff, 1987; Atkeson, 1989; Moore, 1990; 1991). However, these previous studies did not highlight the fact that small changes in the design of these algorithms drastically alter their learning behavior. This paper describes a preliminary study that investigates this issue in the context of a difficult dynamic control task: learning to catch a ball moving in a three-dimensional space, an important problem in robotics research (Geng et al., 1991). Our thesis in this paper is that agents can improve substantially at physical tasks by storing experiences without explicitly...
