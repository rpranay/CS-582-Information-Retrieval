OZONE: A Zoomable Interface for Navigating Ontology Information We present OZONE (Zoomable Ontology Navigator), for searching and browsing ontological  information. OZONE visualizes query conditions and provides interactive, guided browsing for  DAML (DARPA Agent Markup Language) ontologies. To visually represent objects in DAML, we  define a visual model for its classes, properties and relationships between them. Properties can be  expanded into classes for query refinement. The visual query can be formulated incrementally as  users explore class and property structures interactively. Zoomable interface techniques are  employed for effective navigation and usability.  Keywords: Ontology, DAML, Browsing, Zoomable User Interface (ZUI), Jazz, WWW.
