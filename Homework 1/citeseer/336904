Learning to Recognize 3D Objects A learning account for the problem of object recognition is developed within the  PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) model of learnability. The key assumption  underlying this work is that objects can be recognized (or, discriminated) using simple  representations in terms of \syntactically" simple relations over the raw image. Although  the potential number of these simple relations could be huge, only a few of  them are actually present in each observed image and a fairly small number of those  observed is relevant to discriminating an object.  We show that these properties can be exploited to yield an ecient learning approach  in terms of sample and computational complexity, within the PAC model. No  assumptions are needed on the distribution of the observed objects and the learning  performance is quantied relative to its past experience. Most importantly, the success  of learning an object representation is naturally tied to the ability to represent it as a  function of some in...
