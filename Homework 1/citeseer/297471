Subsumption for XML Types . XML data is often used (validated, stored, queried, etc) with  respect to different types. Understanding the relationship between these  types can provide important information for manipulating this data. We  propose a notion of subsumption for XML to capture such relationships.  Subsumption relies on a syntactic mapping between types, and  can be used for facilitating validation and query processing. We study  the properties of subsumption, in particular the notion of the greatest  lower bound of two schemas, and show how this can be used as a guide  for selecting a storage structure. While less powerful than inclusion, subsumption  generalizes several other mechanisms for reusing types, notably  extension and refinement from XML Schema, and subtyping.  1 Introduction  XML [5] is a data format for Web applications. As opposed to e.g., relational databases, XML documents do not have to be created and used with respect to a fixed, existing schema. This is particularly useful in Web ap...
