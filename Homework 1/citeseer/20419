An Efficient Index Structure for OID Indexing in Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems . In an object-oriented database system based on logical OIDs, an OID index (OIDX) is necessary to convert from logical OID to physical location. In a temporal objectoriented database system (TOODB), this OIDX also contains the timestamps of the object versions. We have in a previous paper studied OIDX performance with a relatively simple index. The studies have shown that OIDX maintenance can be quite costly, especially objects updates, because in a temporal OODB, the OIDX needs to be updated every time an object is updated. This has convinced us that a new index structure, particularly suitable to TOODB requirements, is necessary. In this report, we describe an efficient OID index structure for TOODBs, which we call The Vagabond Temporal OID Index (VTOIDX). The main goals of the VTOIDX is 1) support for temporal data, while still having index performance close to a non-temporal/one version database system, 2) efficient object-relational operation, and 3) easy tertiary storage migrati...
