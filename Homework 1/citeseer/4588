Semantics-Based Information Retrieval : In this paper we investigate the use of conceptual descriptions based on description logics for contentbased information retrieval and present several innovative contributions. We provide a query-byexamples retrieval framework which avoids the drawback of a sophisticated query language. We extend an existing DL to deal with spatial concepts. We provide a content-based similarity measure based on the least common subsumer which extracts conceptual similarities of examples. 1 Introduction As more and more information of various kinds becomes available for an increasing number of users, one major challenge for Computer Science is to provide e#cient access and retrieval mechanisms. This is not only true for Web-based information which by its nature tends to be highly unorganized and heterogeneous, but also for dedicated databases which are designed to provide a particular service. The guiding example of this paper is a "TV-Assistant" with a database containing TV-program information. Its...
