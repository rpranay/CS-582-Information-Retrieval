We present observations from a user study that compares three tools for browsing program source code and exploring software structures. In this study, 30 participants used these tools to solve several high-level program understanding tasks. These tasks required a broad range of comprehension strategies. We describe how these tools supported or hindered the diverse comprehension strategies used.
