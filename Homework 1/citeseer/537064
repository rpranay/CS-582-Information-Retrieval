Enhancing the Sense of Other Learners in Student-Centred Web-Based Education Student-centred learning can be used in Web-courses to increase student activity, motivation and commitment. EDUCO is a system for student-centred learning, both for the learners and the teachers. Students can use EDUCO within a standard web-browser to navigate towards useful information and Web-resources gathered into the system. The key issue is that every participant can see everyone else in the system and their navigational steps, so that the feeling of student companions taking part in the same tasks is increased. The implications of this type of social navigation are discussed along with the description of the system itself. 1.
