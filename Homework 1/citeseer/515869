A Two-stage Scheme for Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition In this paper a scheme is presented for recognizing hand gestures using the output of a hand tracker which tracks a rectangular window bounding the hand region. A hierarchical scheme for dynamic hand gesture recognition is proposed based on state representation of the dominant feature trajectories using an a priori knowledge of the way in which each gesture is performed.
