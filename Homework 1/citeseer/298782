Efficient and Effective Metasearch for Text Databases Incorporating Linkages among Documents Linkages among documents have a significant impact on the importance of documents, as it can be argued that important documents are pointed to by many documents or by other important documents. Metasearch engines can be used to facilitate ordinary users for retrieving information from multiple local sources (text databases). In a large-scale metasearch engine, the contents of each local database is represented by a representative. Each user query is evaluated against the set of representatives of all databases in order to determine the appropriate databases to search. In previous works, the linkage information between documents has not been utilized in determining the appropriate databases to search. In this paper, such information is employed to determine the degree of relevance of a document with respect to a given query. This information is then stored in each database representative to facilitate the selection of databases for each given query. We establish a necessary an...
