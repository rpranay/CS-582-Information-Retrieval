Combining Positional Information with Visual Media By integrating visual media with positioning information obtained with our wearable computer, we create new opportunities for using visuals both in the field and at the workstation. The position information we store with each visual is direction, pitch, roll, location, focal length, and zoom. This information allows any system to reconstruct the frustum of the visual, and, if height data is available to reconstruct which parts of the earth are visible in the visual. This enables position based lookup and 3D mosaicing of visuals to reconstruct a 3D model.  1 Introduction  We are interested in the association of media files with contextual information gathered by our wearable computer. We have previously explored the combination of audio notes, or reminders, with locations [1]. In this paper we turn our attention to visuals.  Classic photographs and videos store only visual information. Recent advances in photo and video technology have increased the amount of information which can be st...
