Are you ready for Yottabytes? StorHouse - Federated and Object/Relational Solution This paper describes how federated and object/relational database systems can exploit cost-effective active storage hierarchies. By active storage hierarchy we mean a database system that uses all storage media (i.e. optical, tape, and disk) to store and retrieve data and not just disk. A detailed discussion of the Atomic Data Store data warehouse concept can be found in [CB 99]. These also describe a commercial relational database product, StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM), that executes SQL queries directly against data stored in a complete storage hierarchy. This paper focuses on applications that can use, and may even require the use of, emerging federated and object/relational database technologies. Our analysis is based on two products now in development. We will refer to these as StorHouse/Fed (a federated database system that includes StorHouse/RM) and StorHouse/ORM (an Object-Relational database system). We conclude by describing candidate applications (with an emphasis on the federal sector) that can exploit the combination of costeffective active storage hierarchy with federated and/or object/relational database technology.
