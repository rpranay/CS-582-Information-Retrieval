Evaluation of Recommender Algorithms for an Internet Information Broker Based Association rules are a widely used technique to generate recommendations in commercial and research recommender systems. Since more and more Web sites, especially of retailers, offer automatic recommender services using Web usage mining, evaluation of recommender algorithms becomes increasingly important. In this paper we first present a framework for the evaluation of different aspects of recommender systems based on the process of discovering knowledge in databases of Fayyad et al. and then we focus on the comparison of the performance of two recommender algorithms based on frequent itemsets. The first recommender algorithm uses association rules, and the other recommender algorithm is based on the repeat-buying theory known from marketing research. For the evaluation we concentrated on how well the patterns extracted from usage data match the concept of useful recommendations of users. We use 6 month of usage data from an educational Internet information broker and compare useful recommendations identified by users from the target group of the broker with the results of the recommender algorithms. The results of the evaluation presented in this paper suggest that frequent itemsets from purchase histories match the concept of useful recommendations expressed by users with satisfactory accuracy (higher than 70%) and precision (between 60% and 90%). Also the evaluation suggests that both algorithms studied in the paper perform similar on real-world data if they are tuned properly.
