Integrating Peer-to-Peer Networking and Computing in the Agentscape Framework The combination of peer-to-peer networking and agentbased computing seems to be a perfect match. Agents are cooperative and communication oriented, while peerto -peer networks typically support distributed systems in which all nodes have equal roles and responsibilities. AgentScape is a framework designed to support large-scale multi-agent systems. Pole extends this framework with peerto -peer computing. This combination facilitates the development and deployment of new agent-based peer-to-peer applications and services.
