Boosting Interval-Based Literals: Variable Length and Early Classification In previous works, a system for supervised time series classification has been presented. It is based on boosting very simple classifiers: only one literal. The used predicates are based on temporal intervals. There are two types of predicates: i) relative predicates, such as "increases" and "stays", and ii) region predicates, such as "always" and "sometime", which operate ver regions in the domain of the variable.
