Formal ReSpecT Logic tuple centres have s own that logic-ba d languages can be e#ectively exploited not only for building individual agents and enabling interagent communication in multi-agent ssG ms butals for  ruli ng inter-agent communications as to builds cial behaviours In this paper, we formally define the notion of logic tuple centre as well as the operationals emantics of the logic-bas d language ReSpecT for the behaviours pecification of logic tuple centres . For this purpos e, we exploit a generals emantic framework for as ynchronous dis tributeds ys tems allowing a coordination medium to be formally denoted in as eparate and independent way with res pect to the whole coordinateds ys tem. This s hows that a logic-bas ed coordination medium does not limit agents and coordination languages to be logic-bas ed, but may ins  tead enable agents of di#erents orts and technologies to be combined and coordinated in an e#ective way by exploiting a logic-bas ed approach. 1 Coordinationm edia form ulti...
