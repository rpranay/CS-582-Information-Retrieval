Query Processing in Relationlog . Relationlog is a persistent deductive database system that  supports eective storage, ecient access and inference of large amounts  of data with complex structures. In this paper, we describe query processing  in the Relationlog system. In particular, we illustrate the extended  semi-naive and magic-set techniques used in Relationlog.  1 Introduction  During the past decades, the nested relational and complex object models [1, 5, 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22] were developed to extend the applicability of the traditional relational model to more complex, non-business applications such as CAD, image processing and text retrieval [2].  Another important direction of intense research has been in using a logic programming based language Datalog [8, 23] as a database query language. Such a language provides a simple and natural way to express queries on a relational database and is more expressive than the traditional relational languages.  In the past several years, there have been some eorts...
