How to Interpret Neural Networks In Terms of Fuzzy Logic? Neural networks are a very efficient learning tool, e.g., for transforming an experience of an expert human controller into the design of an automatic controller. It is desirable to reformulate the neural network expression for the input-output function in terms most understandable to an expert controller, i.e., by using words from natural language. There are several methodologies for transforming such natural-language knowledge into a precise form; since these methodologies have to take into consideration the uncertainty (fuzziness) of natural language, they are usually called fuzzy logics.  1
