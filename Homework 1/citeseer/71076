Formalisms for Multi-Agent Systems This report is the result of a panel discussion at the First UK Workshop on Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems (FoMAS '96). All members of the panel are authors, listed alphabetically. as knowledge representation language, for direct manipulation within an agent system, is exemplified in the work of Konolige on formalisms for modelling belief, and logic as a programming language is evidenced in the work of Fisher on Concurrent METATEM. All of these strands of work can claim some measure of success. However, a common failing of formal work (both in AI and multi-agent systems) is that its role is not clear. Formal agent theories are agent specifications, not only in the sense of providing descriptions and constraints on agent behaviour, but also in the sense that one understands the term `specification' from mainstream software engineering, namely that they provide a base from which to design, implement and verify agent systems. Agents are a natural next step for software engineering; they represent a fundamentally new way of considering complex distributed systems, containing societies of cooperating autonomous components. If we aim to build such systems, then principled techniques will be required for their design and implementation. We aim to assist the development of such systems by providing formalisms and notations that can be used to specify the desirable behaviour of agents and multi-agent systems; a requirement is that we should be able to move in a principled way from specifications of such systems to implementations. The properties identified by using a formalism serve to measure and evaluate implementations of agent systems. Some properties currently seem to be unimplementable, because they deal with an idealised aspect of agency, such as knowledge. Still, t...
