On Constructing the Right Sort of CBR Implementation Case based reasoning implementations as currently  constructed tend to #t three general  models, characterized by implementation constraints:   task-based #task alone#, enterprise #integrating  databases#, and web-based #integrating  web representations#. These implementations  represent the targets for automatic system  construction, and it is important to understand  the strengths of each, how they are built,  and how one may be constructed by transforming  another. This paper describes a framework  that relates the three types of CBR implementation,  discusses their typical strengths and  weaknesses, and describes practical methods  for automating the construction of new CBR  systems by transforming and synthesizing existing  resources.  1 Introduction  CBR systems as currently constructed tend to #t three general implementation models, de#ned by broad implementation constraints on representation and process.  Traditionally, task-based implementations have addressed system goals bas...
