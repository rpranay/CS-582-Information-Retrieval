Autonomous Cyber Agents: Rules For Collaboration A cyber agent is any program, machine or person engaged in computer-enabled work. Thus, cyber agents can vary considerably in complexity and intelligence. Can they, despite their variety, be organized to collaborate effectively ? Both empirical evidence and theory suggest that they can. Moreover, there seem to be simple rules for designing problem-solving organizations in which collaboration among cyber agents is automatic and scale-effective (adding agents tends to improve solution-quality; adding computers tends to improve solution-speed). This paper develops some of these rules.  1. INTRODUCTION  Computer networks make it possible to interconnect and therefore, organize, large numbers of distributed cyber agents, varying in type from simple programs to skilled humans. Our goal is to develop a class of organizations in which such agents can collaborate easily and effectively. More specifically, our goal is to develop methods for routinely solving arbitrary instances of the following ...
