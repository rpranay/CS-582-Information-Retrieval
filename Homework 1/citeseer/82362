Twenty-One at TREC-7: Ad-hoc and Cross-language track This paper describes the official runs of the Twenty-One group for TREC-7. The Twenty-One group participated in the ad-hoc and the cross-language track and made the following accomplishments: We developed a new weighting algorithm, which outperforms the popular Cornell version of BM25 on the ad-hoc collection. For the CLIR task we developed a fuzzy matching algorithm to recover from missing translations and spelling variants of proper names. Also for CLIR we investigated translation strategies that make extensive use of information from our dictionaries by identifying preferred translations, main translations and synonym translations, by defining weights of possible translations and by experimenting with probabilistic boolean matching strategies. 1 Introduction  Twenty-One is a 2 MECU project with 12 partners funded by the EU Telematics programme, sector Information Engineering. The project subtitle is "Development of a Multimedia Information Transaction and Dissemination Tool". Twenty...
