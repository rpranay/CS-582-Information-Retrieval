Mobile Agent Organizations Mobile agents are a useful paradigm -- other than a useful technology -- for the development of complex Internet applications. However, the effective development of mobile agent applications requires suitable models and infrastructures. This paper proposes an organizational approach to the high-level design of mobile agent applications. The idea is to models the Internet as a multiplicity of local and active organizational contexts, intended as the places where coordination activities of application agents occur and are ruled. The paper discusses the advantages and the generality of such an approach, also with the help of a case study in the area of tourist assistance.
