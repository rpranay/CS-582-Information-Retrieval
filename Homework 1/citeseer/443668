Instant Messaging and Awareness of Presence in WebWho This is a study of how awareness of presence affects content of instant messages via an awareness tool, WebWho. The awareness tool is an easily accessible web based system that visualises a large university computer lab. The instant messaging system is one of the functions of the tool, which allows students to virtually locate one another and to communicate via the instant messaging system. As WebWho is there to be accessed through any web browser, it requires no programming skills or special software. It may also be used from outside the computer lab by students located elsewhere.
