Building Infrastructures for Digital Libraries Digital Libraries today are often monolithic systems. In the future, they will dissolve  into collections of electronic services. The challenge will be to provide an infrastructure  that supports the user in dealing with this multitude of services. Such an infrastructure  should offer integrated access to the combined contents of multiple services, it should provide  active dissemination of new contents, and it needs to support the users in locating and  combining the services most suitable to their needs.  In the Global Info program Infrastructures for Digital Libraries components of such  an infrastructure are being developed. The federated query service DEMETRIOS and the  alerting service HERMES are both integration services that combine underlying services,  i.e., heterogenous information sources. The GIBRALTAR portal provides a meta-service  that supports the user in locating and applying various Digital Library services.  1
