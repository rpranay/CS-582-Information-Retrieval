Relational Transducers for Electronic Commerce Electronic commerce is emerging as one of the major Websupported applications requiring database support. We introduce and study high-level declarative specifications of business models, using an approach in the spirit of active databases. More precisely, business models are specified as  relational transducers that map sequences of input relations into sequences of output relations. The semantically meaningful trace of an input-output exchange is kept as a sequence of log relations. We consider problems motivated by electronic commerce applications, such as log validation, verifying temporal properties of transducers, and comparing two relational transducers. Positive results are obtained for a restricted class of relational transducers called Spocus transducers (for semi-positive outputs and cumulative state). We argue that despite the restrictions, these capture a wide range of practically significant business models.  1 Introduction  Electronic commerce is emerging as a major Web-s...
