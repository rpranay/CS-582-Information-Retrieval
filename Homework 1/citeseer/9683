A Control Architecture for Flexible Internet Auction Servers The flexibility to support both high activity and low activity auctions is required by any system that allows bidding by both humans and software agents. We present the control architecture of the Michigan Internet AuctionBot, and discuss some of the system engineering issues that arose in its design. 1 Introduction  The Michigan Internet AuctionBot is a highly configurable auction server built to support research on electronic commerce and multiagent negotiation [3]. The first generation architecture was simple and robust, and allowed us to concentrate on other aspects of the system. However, several inefficiencies made it problematic to run auctions with very fast interactions. We have redesigned the core AuctionBot architecture in order to improve overall performance, while still meeting the original goal: a system that is configurable, maintainable, and capable of conducting a large number of simultaneous auctions. In AuctionBot architecture nomenclature, we say an auction is open ...
