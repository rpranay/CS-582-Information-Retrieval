An Agent-Based Approach to the Construction of Floristic Digital Libraries This paper describes an agent-assisted approach to the construction of floristic digital libraries, which consist of very large botanical data repositories and related services. We propose an environment, termed Chrysalis, in which authors of plant morphologic descriptions can enter data into a digital library via a web-based editor. An agent that runs concurrently with the editor suggests potentially useful morphologic descriptions based on similar documents existing in the library. Benefits derived from the introduction of Chrysalis include reduced potential for errors and data inconsistencies, increased parallelism among descriptions, and considerable savings in the time regularly spent in visually checking for parallelism and manually editing data.  KEYWORDS: agents, agent-based interfaces, floristic digital libraries, FNA, Chrysalis.  INTRODUCTION  Constructing the vast data repositories that will support knowledge-intensive activities in digital libraries poses problems of enormo...
