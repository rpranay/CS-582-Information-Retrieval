An Open Framework for Distributed Multimedia Retrieval This article describes a framework for distributed multimedia retrieval which permits the  connection of compliant user interfaces with a variety of multimedia retrieval engines via an  open communication protocol, MRML (Multi Media Retrieval Markup Language). It allows  the choice of image collection, feature set and query algorithm during run{time, permitting  multiple users to query a system adapted to their needs, using the query paradigm adapted  to their problem such as query by example (QBE), browsing queries, or query by annotation.  User interaction is implemented over several levels and in diverse ways. Relevance feedback  is implemented using positive and negative example images that can be used for a  best{match QBE query. In contrast, browsing methods try to approach the searched image  by giving overviews of the entire collection and by successive renement. In addition to these  query methods, Long term o line learning is implemented. It allows feature preferences per  ...
