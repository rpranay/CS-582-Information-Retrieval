The Evaluation of Microplanning and Surface Realization in the Generation of Multimodal Acts of Communication In this paper, we describe an application domain which requires the computational simulation of human-human communication in which one of the interlocutors has an expressive communication disorder. The importance and evaluation of a process, called here microplanning and surface realization, for such communicative agents is discussed and a related exploratory study is described.  1
