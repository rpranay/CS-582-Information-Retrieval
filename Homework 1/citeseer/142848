Extending the ODMG Object Model with Time Although many temporal extensions of the relational data model have been proposed, there is no comparable amount of work in the context of object-oriented data models. Moreover, extensions to the relational model have been proposed in the framework of SQL standards, whereas no attempts have been made to extend the standard for object-oriented databases, defined by ODMG. This paper presents T ODMG, a temporal extension of the ODMG-93 standard data model. The main contributions of this work are, thus, the formalization of the ODMG standard data model and its extension with time. Another contribution of this work is the investigation, on a formal basis, of the main issues arising from the introduction of time in an object-oriented model.
