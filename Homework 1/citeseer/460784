Extending Multi-Agent Cooperation by Overhearing Much cooperation among humans happens following a common pattern:  by chance or deliberately, a person overhears a conversation between  two or more parties and steps in to help, for instance by suggesting answers  to questions, by volunteering to perform actions, by making observations  or adding information. We describe an abstract architecture to support a  similar pattern in societies of articial agents. Our architecture involves  pairs of so-called service agents (or services) engaged in some tasks, and  unlimited number of suggestive agents (or suggesters). The latter have  an understanding of the work behaviors of the former through a publicly  available model, and are able to observe the messages they exchange. Depending  on their own objectives, the understanding they have available,  and the observed communication, the suggesters try to cooperate with  the services, by initiating assisting actions, and by sending suggestions to  the services. These in eect may induce a change in services behavior.  To test our architecture, we developed an experimental, multi-agent Web  site. The system has been implemented by using a BDI toolkit, JACK  Intelligent Agents.  Keywords: autonomous agents, multiagent systems, AI architectures, distributed AI.  1
