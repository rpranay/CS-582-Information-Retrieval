The personal interaction panel - a two-handed interface for augmented reality This paper describes the introduction of a new interaction paradigm to augmented reality applications. The everyday tool handling experience of working with pen and notebooks is extended to create a three dimensional two-handed interface, that supports easy-to-understand manipulation tasks in augmented and virtual environments. In the design step we take advantage from the freedom, given by our very low demands on hardware and augment form and functionality to this device. On the basis of examples from object manipulation, augmented research environments and scientific visualization we show the generality of applicability. Although being in the first stages implementation, we consider the wide spectrum of suitability for different purposes.
