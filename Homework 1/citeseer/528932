Inverted files and dynamic signature files for optimisation of Web Directories Web directories are taxonomies for the classification of Web documents. This kind of IR systems present a specific type of search where the document collection is restricted to one area of the category graph. This paper introduces a specific data architecture for Web directories which improves the performance of restricted searches. That architecture is based on a hybrid data structure composed of an inverted file with multiple embedded signature files. Two variants based on the proposed model are presented: hybrid architecture with total information and hybrid architecture with partial information. The validity of this architecture has been analysed by means of developing both variants to be compared with a basic model. The performance of the restricted queries was clearly improved, specially the hybrid model with partial information, which yielded a positive response under any load of the search system.
