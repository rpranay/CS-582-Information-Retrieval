NEXUS - Distributed Data Management Concepts for Location Aware Applications Nowadays, mobile computers like subnotebooks or personal digital  assistants, as well as cellular phones can not only communicate wirelessly, but  they can also determine their position via appropriate sensors like DGPS. Socalled  location aware applications take advantage of this fact and structure information  according to the position of their users. In order to be able to assign  data to a certain location, these information systems have to refer to spatial  computer models. The NEXUS    project, which is supported by the Deutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), aims at the development  of a generic infrastructure that serves as a basis for location aware  applications. The central task of this platform deals with the data management.
