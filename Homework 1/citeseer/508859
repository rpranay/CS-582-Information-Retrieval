A Visual Modality for the Augmentation of Paper In this paper we describe how we have enhanced our multimodal paper-based system, Rasa, with visual perceptual input. We briefly explain how Rasa improves upon current decisionsupport tools by augmenting, rather than replacing, the paperbased tools that people in command and control centers have come to rely upon. We note shortcomings in our initial approach, discuss how we have added computer-vision as another input modality in our multimodal fusion system, and characterize the advantages that it has to offer. We conclude by discussing our current limitations and the work we intend to pursue to overcome them in the future.
