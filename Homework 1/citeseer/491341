Multi-Document Summarization and Visualization in the Informedia Digital Video Library The Informedia Digital Video Library project provided a technological foundation for full content indexing and retrieval of video and audio media. The library now contains over 2000 hours of video and is growing daily. A good query engine is not sufficient for information retrieval because often the candidate result sets grow in number as the library grows. Video digests summarize sets of stories from the library, providing users with a visual mechanism for interactive browsing and query refinement. These digests are generated dynamically under the direction of the user based on automatically derived metadata from the video library. Informedia Digital Video Library Foundation Work The Informedia Digital Video Library focused on the development and integration of technologies for information extraction from video and audio content to enable its full content search and retrieval. Over two terabytes (2000 hours, 5,000 segments) of online data was collected, with automatically generated metadata and indices for retrieving video segments from this library. Informedia successfully pioneered the automatic creation of multimedia abstractions, demonstrated empirical proofs of their relative benefits, and gathered usage data of different summarizations and abstractions. Fundamental research and prototyping was conducted in the following areas, shown with a sampling of references to particular work:
