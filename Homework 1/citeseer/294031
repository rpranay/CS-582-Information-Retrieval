A Foundation for Representing and Querying Moving Objects Spatio-temporal databases deal with geometries changing over time. The goal of our work is to provide a DBMS data model and query language capable of handling such time-dependent geometries, including those changing continuously which describe moving objects. Two fundamental abstractions are moving point and moving region, describing objects for which only the time-dependent position, or position and extent, are of interest, respectively. We propose to represent such time-dependent geometries as attribute data types with suitable operations, that is, to provide an abstract data type extension to a DBMS data model and query language. This paper presents a design of such a system of abstract data types. It turns out that besides the main types of interest, moving point and moving region, a relatively large number of auxiliary data types is needed. For example, one needs a line type to represent the projection of a moving point into the plane, or a ???moving real ??? to represent the time-dependent distance of two moving points. It then becomes crucial to achieve (i) orthogonality in the design of the type system, i.e., type constructors can be applied uniformly, (ii) genericity
