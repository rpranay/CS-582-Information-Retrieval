Mansion: A Structured Middleware Environment for Agents Developing processes intended to roam in largescale heterogeneous distributed systems is difficult: their environment is unstructured, and interoperability issues often emerge.

Security, transparency, and interoperability are important design guidelines for the development of Mansion.
