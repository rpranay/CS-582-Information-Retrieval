Dynamic CPU Scheduling with Imprecise Knowledge of Computation-Time : The majority of the studies conducted in scheduling real-time transactions mostly concentrate  on concurrency control protocols, while overlooking the CPU as being the primary resource.  Consequently, there are various techniques for scheduling the CPU in conventional time-critical systems;  meanwhile, there does not seem to be any technique that is adequately designed for scheduling  such a resource in Real-Time Database (RTDB) systems. In this paper, we construct an efficient CPU  scheduling scheme that minimizes the preemption rate in order to reduce the frequency by which synchronization  protocols must be invoked, along with their inherited performance degradation. In addition,  we also introduce a new timing model upon which the newly introduced scheduler is incorpo-  rated in order to utilize the system's imprecise knowledge of computation time estimates.  Keywords: CPU Scheduling, lowering-preemption, timeliness-functions, and imprecise computation  estimates.  1. INTRODUCTIO...
