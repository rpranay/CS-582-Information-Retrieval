Essex Wizards'99 Team Description : This paper describes the Essex Wizards team participated in the  RoboCup'99 simulator league. It is mainly concentrated on a multi-threaded  implementation of simulated soccer agents to achieve real-time performance.  Simulated robot agents work at three distinct phases: sensing, thinking and  acting. POSIX threads are adopted to implement them concurrently. The issues  of decision-making and co-operation are also addressed.  1. Introduction  In the RoboCup simulator environment, the response time of a soccer agent becomes significantly important since the soccer server operates with 100ms cycles for executing actions and 150ms cycles for providing sensory data [12]. Moreover, auditory sensory data can be received at random intervals. It is vital that each agent has bounded response times. If an action is not generated within 100ms, then the agent will stay idle for that cycle and enemy agents that did act might gain an advantage. On the other hand, if more than one action is generat...
