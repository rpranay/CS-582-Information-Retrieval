Query Evaluation for Mediators over Web Catalogs The Web catalogs like Yahoo! and Open Directory  are very useful for browsing and querying the Web. Although  they index only a fraction of the pages that are indexed by search  engines these catalogs are hand-crafted by domain experts and  are therefore of high quality. We present a model for building  mediators over Web catalogs, so as to provide users with customized   views of such catalogs. We focus on query evaluation,  specifically on the complexity of query answering by the mediator.
