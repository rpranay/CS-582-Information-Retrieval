Partial Models of Extended Generalized Logic Programs . In recent years there has been an increasing interest in extensions  of the logic programming paradigm beyond the class of normal  logic programs motivated by the need for a satisfactory respresentation  and processing of knowledge. An important problem in this area is to find  an adequate declarative semantics for logic programs. In the present paper  a general preference criterion is proposed that selects the `intended'  partial models of extended generalized logic programs which is a conservative  extension of the stationary semantics for normal logic programs  of [13], [15] and generalizes the WFSX-semantics of [12]. The presented  preference criterion defines a partial model of an extended generalized  logic program as intended if it is generated by a stationary chain. The  GWFSX-semantics is defined by the set-theoretical intersection of all  stationary generated models, and thus generalizes the results from [9]  and [1].  1 Introduction  Declarative semantics provides a mathem...
