Optimization of User-Defined Functions in Distributed Object-Relational DBMS Full support of parallelism in object-relational database systems (ORDBMSs) is desired. The parallelization techniques developed for relational database systems are not adequate for ORDBMS because of the introduction of complex abstract data types and operations on ordered domains. In this paper, we consider a data stream paradigm and develop a query parallelization framework that exploits characteristics of user-defined functions in a ORDBMS during query optimization. By introducing the concept of windows and abstract data type orderings, we develop a novel approach for parallelizing user-defined functions in a distributed ORDBMS environment. The implementation issues in providing query services in ordered domains are also discussed. 1 Introduction As time goes by, more and more database vendors agree that Object-Relational DBMSs (ORDBMSs) are the future [23]. Though full support of parallel ORDBMS is expected, the techniques used to parallelize relational database systems are not ad...
