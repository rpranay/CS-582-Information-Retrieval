Using Case-Based Learning to Improve Genetic-Algorithm-Based Design Optimization In this paper we describe a method for improving genetic-algorithm-based optimization using case-based learning. The idea is to utilize the sequence of points explored during a search to guide further exploration. The proposed method is particularly suitable for continuous spaces with expensive evaluation functions, such as arise in engineering design. Empirical results in two engineering design domains and across different representations demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the GA optimizer. Moreover, the results suggest that the modification makes the genetic algorithm less sensitive to poor choices of tuning parameters such as mutation rate. 1 Introduction  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [ Goldberg 1989 ] are search algorithms that simulate the process of natural selection. GAs attempt to find a good solution to some problem (e.g., finding the maximum of a function) by randomly generating a collection ("population") of potential...
