Continuous Conceptual Set Covering: Learning Robot Operators From Examples Continuous Conceptual Set Covering (CCSC) is  an algorithm that uses engineering knowledge to  learn operator effects from training examples.  The program produces an operator hypothesis  that, even in noisy and nondeterministic  domains, can make good quantitative  predictions. An empirical evaluation in the traytilting  domain shows that CCSC learns faster  than an alternative case-based approach. The  best results, however, come from integrating  CCSC and the case-based approach.  Figure 1. Experimental Set Up  1. INTRODUCTION  Initially, the robot knows how to physically execute the tilt_operator. It does not, however, know the effects of the operator. When the tray-tilt operator is executed, the robot tips the tray down 30 from the horizontal in the direction of tilt. The new position of the puck is hard to predict because of uncertainty in the initial conditions (the initial position of the puck and the tilting angle are continuous values subject to measurement error). In additio...
