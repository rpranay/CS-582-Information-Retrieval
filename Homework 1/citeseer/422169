Keys for XML this paper. The proposal extends the key speci  cation of XML Data by allowing one to specify keys in terms of XPath [24] expressions. There are a number of technical problems in connection with XPath. XPath is a relatively complex language in which one can not only move down the document tree, but also sideways or upwards, not to mention that predicates and functions can be embedded as well. The problem with XPath is that questions about equivalence or inclusion of XPath expressions are, as far as the authors are aware, unresolved; and these issues are importantifwewant to reason about keys as wedo  in relational databases. Yet until we know how to determine the equivalence of XPath expressions, there is no general method of saying whether two such speci  cations are equivalent. Another technical issue is value equality. XML Schema restricts equality to text, but the authors have encountered cases in whichkeys are not so restricted. See Section 7.1 for a more detailed discussion. However, the main reason for writing this paper is that none of the existing key proposals address the issue of hierarchical keys, which appear to be ubiquitous in hierarchically structured databases, especially in scienti  c data formats. A top-level key may be used to identify components of a document, and within each component a secondary key is used to identify sub-components, and so on. Moreover, the authors believe that the use of keys for citing parts of a document is suciently important that it is appropriate to consider key speci  cation independently of other proposals for constraining the structure of XML documents
