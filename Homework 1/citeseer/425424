Ontobroker: How to make the WWW Intelligent . The World Wide Web can be viewed as the largest knowledge base  that has ever existed. However, its support in query answering and automated  inference is very limited. We propose formalized ontologies as means to enrich  web documents for representing semantic information to overcome this  bottleneck. Ontologies enable informed search as well as the derivation of new  knowledge that is not represented in the WWW. The paper describes a software  tool called Ontobroker that provides the necessary support in realizing this idea.  Basically it provides formalisms and tools for formulating queries, for defining  ontologies, and for annotating HTML documents with ontological information.  1 Introduction  The World Wide Web (WWW) contains huge amounts of knowledge about most subjects one can think of. HTML documents enriched by multi-media applications provide knowledge in different representations (i.e., text, graphics, animated pictures, video, sound, virtual reality, etc.). Hypertext li...
