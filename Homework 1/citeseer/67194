An Fft-Based Algorithm For Multichannel Blind Deconvolution A new update equation for the general multichannel blind deconvolution (MCBD) of a convolved mixture of source signals is derived. It is based on the update equation for blind source separation (BSS), which has been shown to be an alternative interpretation [1] of the natural gradient applied to the minimization of some mutual information criterion [2]. Computational complexity is held at a minimum by carrying out the separation/equalization task in the frequency domain. The algorithm is compared to similar known blind algorithms and its validity is demonstrated by simulations of real-world acoustic filters. In order to assess the performance of the algorithm, performance measures for multichannel blind deconvolution of signals are given in the paper. 1. INTRODUCTION Blind separation, blind deconvolution and the combination of both, multichannel blind deconvolution, are tasks that have to be carried out in an increasing number of applications, particularly in acoustics and communicati...
