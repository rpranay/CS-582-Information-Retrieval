A Semantics of Contrast and Information Structure for Specifying Intonation in Spoken Language Generation In this dissertation I present a model for the determination of intonation contours from context and provide two implemented systems which apply this theory to the problem of generating spoken language with appropriate intonation from high-level semantic representations. The theory and implementations presented here are based on an information structure framework that mediates between intonation and discourse, and encodes the proper level of semantic information to account for both contextually-bound accentuation patterns and intonational phrasing. The structural similarities among these linguistic levels of representation are the basis for selecting Combinatory Categorial Grammar #CCG, Steedman 1985,1990a# as the model for spoken language production. This model licenses congruent syntactic, prosodic and information structural constituents and consequently represents a simpli#cation over models of prosody developed in syntactically more traditional frameworks.  The previous mention heu...
