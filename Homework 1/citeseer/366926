Combining Statistical Measures to Find Image Text Regions We present a method based on statistical properties of local image pixels for focussing attention on regions of text in arbitrary scenes where the text plane is not necessarily fronto-parallel to the camera. This is particularly useful for Desktop or Wearable Computing applications. The statistical measures are chosen to reveal charactersitic properties of text. We combine a number of localised measures using a neural network to classify each pixel as text or non-text. We demonstrate our results on typical images. 1. Introduction  To automatically enter the contents of a text document into a computer, one can place it on a flatbed scanner and use state of the art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to retrieve the characters. However, automatic segmentation and recognition of text in arbitrary scenes, where the text may or may not be fronto-parallel to the viewing plane, is an area of computer vision which has not been extensively researched previously. The problems involved a...
