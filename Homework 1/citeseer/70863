Essential Principles for Workflow Modelling Effectiveness While the specification languages of workflow management systems focus on process execution  semantics, the successful development of workflows relies on a fuller conceptualisation of  business processing, including process semantics. Traditionally, the success of conceptual modelling   techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of certain requirements: conceptualisation  (following the Conceptualisation Principle), expressive power (following the One Hundred Principle)  , comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important requirement, particularly  with the increased conceptualisation of business aspects, is business suitability. In this paper, the  focus is on the suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of (operational)  business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans and land conveyancing.  Based on a previously conducted assessment of a number of integrated techniques, the results of  which are summarised in this paper, fiv...
