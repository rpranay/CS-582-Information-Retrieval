Mixed-Initiative Interaction = Mixed Computation We show that partial evaluation can be usefully viewed as a programming model for realizing mixed-initiative  functionality in interactive applications. Mixed-initiative interaction between two participants is one where the  parties can take turns at any time to change and steer the flow of interaction. We concentrate on the facet of  mixed-initiative referred to as `unsolicited reporting' and demonstrate how out-of-turn interactions by users can  be modeled by `jumping ahead' to nested dialogs (via partial evaluation). Our approach permits the view of  dialog management systems in terms of their native support for staging and simplifying interactions; we characterize  three different voice-based interaction technologies using this viewpoint. In particular, we show that the  built-in form interpretation algorithm (FIA) in the VoiceXML dialog management architecture is actually a (well  disguised) combination of an interpreter and a partial evaluator.
