Pruning Classifiers in a Distributed Meta-Learning System JAM is a powerful and portable agent-based distributed data mining system that employs meta-learning techniques to integrate a number of independent classifiers (concepts) derived in parallel from independent and (possibly) inherently distributed databases. Although metalearning promotes scalability and accuracy in a simple and straightforward manner, brute force meta-learning techniques can result in large, inefficient and some times inaccurate meta-classifier hierarchies. In this paper we explore several techniques for evaluating classifiers and we demonstrate that meta-learning combined with certain pruning methods can achieve similar or even better performance results in a much more cost effective manner.  Keywords: classifier evaluation, pruning, metrics, distributed mining, meta-learning.
