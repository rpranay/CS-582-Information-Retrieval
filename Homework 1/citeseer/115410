OMS Rapid Prototyping System for the Development of Object-Oriented Database Application Systems We present an object-oriented data model and system that supports the development of database application systems through a combination of rapid prototyping and refinement. Prototyping is performed on an abstract application model and is independent of any implementation platform -- supporting not only the design stage, but also analysis and requirements modelling. The underlying model, OM, has a two-level structure which reflects the two aspects of object-oriented database application systems -- data modelling and programming. We are therefore able to cleanly integrate ideas from both the database and software engineering communities and achieve compatibility with object models used in both.  Keywords: Object-oriented database systems, rapid prototyping, database design. 1 Introduction  The design and implementation of object-oriented database application systems presents a software engineering challenge in that it encompasses both application program development and database design. ...
