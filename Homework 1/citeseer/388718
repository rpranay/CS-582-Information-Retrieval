Decidable Fragments of First-Order Modal Logics The paper considers the set ML1 of first-order polymodal formulas the modal operators in which can be applied to subformulas of at most one free variable. Using the mosaic technique, we prove a general satisfiability criterion for formulas in ML1 which reduces the modal satisfiability to the classical one. The criterion is then used to single out a number of new, in a sense optimal, decidable fragments of various predicate modal logics. 1 Introduction  The classical decision problem---to single out expressive and decidable fragments of first-order logic---has a long history and hardly needs any justification: after all, classical first-order logic was and still remains in the very center of logical studies, both in mathematics and applications. Here are only three examples (out of dozens) of such fragments (the choice is not accidental---we shall use these results later on):  ffl the fragment containing only monadic predicate symbols [5];  ffl the fragment with only two individual vari...
