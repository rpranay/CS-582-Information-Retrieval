Semantics for an Agent Communication Language . We address the issue of semantics for an agent communication language. In particular, the semantics of Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) is investigated. KQML is a language and protocol to support communication between (intelligent) software agents. Based on ideas from speech act theory, we present a semantic description for KQML that associates "cognitive" states of the agent with the use of the language's primitives (performatives). We have used this approach to describe the semantics for the whole set of reserved KQML performatives. Our research offers a method for a speech act theory-based semantic description of a language of communication acts. Languages of communication acts address the issue of communication between software applications at a level of abstraction that could prove particularly useful to the emerging software agents paradigm of software design and development. 1 Introduction This research is concerned with communication between software agents [13]...
