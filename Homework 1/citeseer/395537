Indexing Techniques for Continuously Evolving Phenomena The management of spatial, temporal, and  spatiotemporal data is becoming increasingly  important in a wide range of applications.  This ongoing Ph.D. project focuses on applications  where spatial or temporal aspects of  objects are continuously changing and there  is a need for indexing techniques that "track"  the changing data, even in-between explicit  updates. In spatiotemporal applications, there  is a need to record and efficiently query the  history, the current state, and the predicted  future behavior of continuously moving objects,  such as vehicles, mobile telephones, and  people. Likewise, in temporal applications  and spatiotemporal applications with discrete  change, time intervals may be naturally related  to the current time, which continuously  progresses. The paper outlines the research  agenda of the Ph.D. project and describes  briefly two access methods developed so far  in this project.  1 Introduction  Recent years have shown both an increase in the amounts of ...
