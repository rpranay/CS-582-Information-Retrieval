XGobi And XploRe Meet Virgis In this paper we report on a linked environment of the three programs XGobi, XploRe, and ViRGIS. While XGobi and XploRe are statistical packages that focus on dynamic statistical graphics and provide analytical statistical features, respectively, ViRGIS is a 3D Virtual Reality Geographic Information System (GIS) that allows real--time access to, and visualization of, geographic data. The XGobi/XploRe/ViRGIS environment is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) technology previously developed for the ArcView/XGobi/XploRe environment. It allows linked brushing and the exchange of data and commands --- completely transparent to the user.  1. Introduction  In our previous work, we developed an open software system consisting of the Geographic Information System (GIS) ArcView, the dynamic statistical graphics program XGobi, and the statistical computing environment XploRe (Symanzik, Kotter, Schmelzer, Klinke, Cook & Swayne 1998, Symanzik, Cook, Klinke & Lewin 1998). In this current projec...
