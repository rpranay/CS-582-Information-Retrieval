Learning Intonation Rules for Concept-to-Speech Generation We aim to design and develop a Concept-to-Speech (CTS) generation system, a speech synthesis system producing speech from semantic representations, by integrating language generation with speech synthesis. We focus on five issues (1) how to employ newly available accurate discourse, semantic, and syntactic information produced by a natural language generation system to improve the quality of synthesized speech. (2) how to extend an existing general purpose natural language generation system to a Concept-to-Speech generation tool. (3) how to integrate rule induction into a CTS architecture to separate the domain-dependent prosodic rules from the prosody generation component. (4) how to design a speech interface language to facilitate a more flexible and open CTS architecture. (5) how to build prosody models and explore their use in multimedia synchronization. Unlike previous CTS research, we utilize linguistic constraints provided by a general purpose natural language generation system;...
