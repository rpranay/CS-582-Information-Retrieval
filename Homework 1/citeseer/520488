Node Similarity in Networked Information Spaces Netvorked information spaces contain information entities, corresponding to nodes, vhich  are (:orlrle(:l.ed [)y associm.i(ms, (:or'r'esporldirlg 1.o links irl (.he nel.wor'k. Exarrq)les of nel.wor'ked  information spaces are: the World Wide Web, vhere information entities are veb pages, and  associations are hyperlinks; the scientific literature, vhere information entities are articles and  associations are references to other articles. SimilariW betveen information entities in a net-  vorked information space can be defined not only based on the content of the information  entities, but also based on the connectivity established by the associations present. This paper  explores the definition of similariW based on connectivity only, and proposes several algorithms  [)r' I, his [mr'pose.
