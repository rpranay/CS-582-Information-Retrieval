Integration of Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition Introduction  "Integration of Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition" may be a surprising title for an ECAI-94 workshop since most Machine Learning (ML) systems are dedicated to Knowledge Acquisition (KA). What could thus mean integrating ML and KA ? The answer lies in the difference between the approaches developed by what is referred to as ML and KA research. Apart from some major exceptions, such as learning apprentice tools [ Mitchell et al., 1989 ] , or libraries like Machine Learning Toolbox [ MLT, 1993 ] , most ML algorithms were described without any characterization in terms of real application needs, in term of what they could be effectively useful for. However, ML methods were applied to "real world" problems, but few general and reusable conclusions were drawn from these knowledge acquisition experiments. As ML techniques become more and more sophisticated and able to produce various forms of knowledge, the number of possible applications grows.
