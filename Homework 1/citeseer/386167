Views in a Large Scale XML Repository We are interested in maintaining and querying views in a huge and highly heterogeneous XML  repository (Web scale). In this context, views are very large and there is no apparent limitation  to their size. This raises interesting problems that we address in the paper: (i) how to distribute  views over several machines without having a negative impact on the query translation process; (ii)  how to quickly select the relevant part of a view given a query; (iii) how to minimize the cost of  communicating potentially large queries to the machines where they will be evaluated.  1 Introduction  We believe that XML will soon take an important and increasing share of the data published on the Web. This represents a major opportunity to, at last, provide an intelligent access to this amazing source of information. With that goal in mind, the Xyleme [18] project is building a warehouse which will store and provide sophisticate database-like services over all the XML documents of the Web. Notably...
