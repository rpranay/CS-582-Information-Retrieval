Learning human arm movements by imitation: Evaluation of a biologically-inspired connectionist architecture . This paper is concerned with the evaluation of a model of human imitation of arm movements. The  model consists of a hierarchy of artificial neural networks, which are abstractions of brain regions involved in  visuo-motor control. These are the spinal cord, the primary and pre-motor cortexes (M1 & PM), the cerebellum,  and the temporal cortex. A biomechanical simulation is developed which models the muscles and the complete  dynamics of a 37 degree of freedom humanoid. Input to the model are data from human arm movements  recorded using video and marker-based tracking systems.  The model's performance is evaluated for reproducing reaching movements and oscillatory movements of the  two arms. Results show a high qualitative and quantitative agreement with human data. In particular, the model  reproduces the well known features of reaching movements in humans, namely the bell-shaped curves for the  velocity and quasi-linear hand trajectories. Finally, the model's performance is compar...
