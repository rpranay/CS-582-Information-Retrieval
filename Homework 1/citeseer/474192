Battery-aware Static Scheduling for Distributed Real-time Embedded Systems This paper addresses battery-aware static scheduling in batterypowered  distributed real-time embedded systems. As suggested by  previous work, reducing the discharge current level and shaping  its distribution are essential for extending the battery lifespan. We  propose two battery-aware static scheduling schemes. The first  one optimizes the discharge power profile in order to maximize  the utilization of the battery capacity. The second one targets  distributed systems composed of voltage-scalable processing  elements (PEs). It performs variable-voltage scheduling via  efficient slack time re-allocation, which helps reduce the average  discharge power consumption as well as flatten the discharge  power profile. Both schemes guarantee the hard real-time  constraints and precedence relationships in the real-time  distributed embedded system specification. Based on previous  work, we develop a battery lifespan evaluation metric which is  aware of the shape of the discharge power profile. Our  experimental results show that the battery lifespan can be  increased by up to 29% by optimizing the discharge power file  alone. Our variable-voltage scheme increases the battery lifespan  by up to 76% over the non-voltage-scalable scheme and by up to  56% over the variable-voltage scheme without slack-time reallocation.  1.
