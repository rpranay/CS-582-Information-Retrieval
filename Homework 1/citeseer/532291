Reconciling Co-Operative Planning and Automated Co-Ordination in Multiagent Systems In the context of cooperative work, the coordination of activities is provided essentially by two opposite classes of approaches, based on the notion of situated action and planning. Actually, given the complexity and dynamism of current cooperative scenarios, the need of model supporting both the approaches has emerged. A similar situation can be recognised in multiagent system coordination, where two classes of approaches are clearly distinguishable, with properties similar to the situated action and planning cases: the one, defined in literature as subjective coordination, accounts for realising coordination exclusively by means of the skills and the situated actions of the individual agents, exploiting their intelligence and communication capability. Among the other properties, these approaches promote autonomy, flexibility and intelligence in coordination processes. The other, defined in literature as objective coordination, accounts for realising coordination exploiting coordination media, which mediate agent interactions and govern them according to laws which reflect social goals and norms. Among the other properties, these approaches promote automation, efficiency, and prescriptiveness in coordination processes. In this work, the importance to support both approaches in the same coordination context is remarked, and a conceptual framework -- derived from Activity Theory -- is proposed, where both approaches effectively co-exist and work at different collaborative levels, exploiting both the flexibility and intelligence of the subjective approaches, and the prescription and automation of the objective ones.
