Situated Computing: A Paradigm to Enhance the Mobile User's Interaction When people interact with computers, they have to pay attention for things that are not related to the situation of the problems because the interfaces are not contextualized to their working environment. Hence it is sometimes hard to integrate computers as embedded tools, which facilitate users to accomplish their objectives easily in the working life. Situated computing is a new paradigm for mobile computer users based on their physical context and activities carried out in the workspace. It defines the infrastructure how the situated interaction can be provided using applications. In this chapter we first describe a model called situation metaphor to design interaction between the user and mobile computers as the basis for the situated computing. Thereafter, a framework called Situated Information Filing and Filtering (SIFF) is presented as the foundation for situated application development. In general a three-stages schema is given considerting the top stage for situated applications. Four applications based on the SIFF are also presented to demonstrate the enhancement of mobile user's interaction that can be achieved.
