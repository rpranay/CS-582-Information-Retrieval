Logical Structure Detection for Heterogeneous Document Classes We present a fully implemented system based on generic document knowledge for detecting the logical structure of documents for which only general layout information is assumed. In particular, we focus on detecting the reading order. Our system integrates components based on computer vision, articial intelligence, and natural language processing techniques. The prominent feature of our framework is its ability to handle documents from heterogeneous collections. The system has been evaluated on a standard collection of documents to measure the quality of the reading order detection. Experimental results for each component and the system as a whole are presented and discussed in detail. The performance of the system is promising, especially when considering the diversity of the document collection.  Keywords: Document Analysis, Logical Structure Detection, Reading Order Detection, Natural Language Processing, Spatial Reasoning.  1. INTRODUCTION  The goal of document analysis is to automa...
