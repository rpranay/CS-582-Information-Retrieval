A Tutorial Dialogue System with Knowledge-Based Understanding and Classification of Student Explanations We are engaged in a research project to create a tutorial  dialogue system that helps students to explain the reasons  behind their problem-solving actions, in order to help them  learn with greater understanding. Currently, we are pilottesting  a prototype system that is able to analyze student  explanations, stated in their own words, recognize the types  of omissions that we typically see in these explanations, and  provide feedback. The system takes a knowledge-based  approach to natural language understanding and uses a  statistical text classifier as a backup. The main features are:  robust parsing, logic-based representation of semantic  content, representation of pedagogical content knowledge in  the form of a hierarchy of partial and complete explanations,  and reactive dialogue management. A preliminary  evaluation study indicates that the knowledge-based natural  language component correctly classifies 80% of  explanations and produces a reasonable classification for all  but 6% of explanations.  1
