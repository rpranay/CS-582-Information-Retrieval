From PETS to Storykit: Creating New Technology with an Intergenerational Design Team Working with children as our design partners, our  intergenerational design team at the University of Maryland  has been developing both new design methodologies and  new storytelling technology for children. In this paper, we  focus on two recent results of our efforts: PETS, a robotic  storyteller, and Storykit, a construction kit of low-tech and  high-tech components to build immersive StoryRooms. We  then describe some lessons we learned.  Introduction  Over the past two years, our intergenerational design team  at the University of Maryland has been developing new design methodologies to create new storytelling technology for children. This team is made of six adult researchers from computer science, education, art, and engineering, and seven children, ages 7 to 11, from local elementary schools. These children stay with us for a long term, at least for one year. The adults are undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty from art, education, engineering, and computer sc...
