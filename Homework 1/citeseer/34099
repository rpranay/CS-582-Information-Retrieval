Mining Optimized Support Rules for Numeric Attributes Mining association rules on large data sets has received considerable attention in recent years. Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of a relation and have applications in marketing, financial and retail sectors. Furthermore, optimized association rules  are an effective way to focus on the most interesting characteristics involving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted to contain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such that either the support, confidence or gain of the rule is maximized. In this paper, we generalize the optimized support association rule problem by permitting rules to contain disjunctions over uninstantiated numeric attributes. Our generalized association rules enable us to extract more useful information about seasonal and local patterns involving the uninstantiated attribute. For rules containing a single numeric attribute, we present a dynamic programming algorith...
