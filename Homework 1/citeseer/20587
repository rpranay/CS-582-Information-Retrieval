Inductive Bias in Case-Based Reasoning Systems In order to learn more about the behaviour of case-based reasoners as learning systems, we formalise a simple case-based learner as a PAC learning algorithm, using the case-based representation  hCB; oei. We first consider a `naive' case-based learning algorithm CB1(oeH ) which learns by collecting all available cases into the case-base and which calculates similarity by counting the number of features on which two problem descriptions agree. We present results concerning the consistency of this learning algorithm and give some partial results regarding its sample complexity. We are able to characterise CB1(oeH ) as a `weak but general' learning algorithm. We then consider how the sample complexity of case-based learning can be reduced for specific classes of target concept by the application of inductive bias, or prior knowledge of the class of target concepts. Following recent work demonstrating how case-based learning can be improved by choosing a similarity measure appropriate to t...
