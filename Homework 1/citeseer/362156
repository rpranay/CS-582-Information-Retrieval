Context Awareness by Analysing Accelerometer Data In this paper we describe continuing work being carried out as part of the Bristol Wearable Computing Initiative. We are researching processing techniques for data from accelerometers which enable the wearable computer to determine the user's activity.  We have experimented with, and review, techniques already employed by others; and then propose new methods for analysing the data delivered by these devices. We try to minimise the number of devices needed, and use a single X-Y accelerometer device.  Using our techniques we have adapted our GPS based Tourist Guide wearable Computer application to include a multimedia presentation which gives the user information using different media depending on the user's activity as well as location.  1 Introduction and Background  This is a condensed version of a technical report. [1]  Our interests in wearable computing are centred around determining the context of the user and developing applications which make use of this information. We are expl...
