Information Retrieval on the World Wide Web and Active Logic: A Survey and Problem Definition As more information becomes available on the World Wide Web (there are currently over 4 billion pages covering most areas of human endeavor), it becomes more difficult to provide effective search tools for information access. Today, people access web information through two main kinds of search interfaces: Browsers (clicking and following hyperlinks) and Query Engines (queries in the form of a set of keywords showing the topic of interest). The first process is tentative and time consuming and the second may not satisfy the user because of many inaccurate and irrelevant results. Better support is needed for expressing one's information need and returning high quality search results by web search tools. There appears to be a need for systems that do reasoning under uncertainty and are flexible enough to recover from the contradictions, inconsistencies, and irregularities that such reasoning involves.
