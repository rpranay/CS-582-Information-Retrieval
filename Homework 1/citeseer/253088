Efficient and Extensible Algorithms for Multi Query Optimization Complex queries are becoming commonplace, with the growing use of decision support systems.  These complex queries often have a lot of common sub-expressions, either within a single query, or  across multiple such queries run as a batch. Multi-query optimization aims at exploiting common subexpressions  to reduce evaluation cost. Multi-query optimization has hither-to been viewed as impractical,  since earlier algorithms were exhaustive, and explore a doubly exponential search space.  In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics is practical, and provides  significant benefits. We propose three cost-based heuristic algorithms: Volcano-SH and Volcano-RU,  which are based on simple modifications to the Volcano search strategy, and a greedy heuristic. Our  greedy heuristic incorporates novel optimizations that improve efficiency greatly. Our algorithms are  designed to be easily added to existing optimizers. We present a performance study comparing the  algo...
