Extracting Collocations from Text Corpora A collocation is a habitual word combination. Collocational knowledge is essential for many tasks in natural language processing. We present a method for extracting collocations from text corpora. By comparison with the SUSANNE corpus, we show that both high precision and broad coverage can be achieved with our method. Finally, we describe an application of the automatically extracted collocations for computing word similarities.
