Efficient Use of Signatures in Object-Oriented Database Systems . Signatures are bit strings, which are generated by applying some hash function on some or all of the attributes of an object. The signatures of the objects can be stored separately from the objects themselves, and can later be used to filter out candidate objects during perfect match queries. In an object-oriented database system (OODB) using logical OIDs, an object identifier index (OIDX) is needed to map from logical OID to the physical location of the object. In this report we show how the signatures can be stored in the OIDX, and used to reduce the average object access cost in a system. We also extend this approach to transaction time temporal OODBs (TOODB), where this approach is even more beneficial, because maintaining signatures comes virtually for free. We develop a cost model that we use to analyze the performance of the proposed approaches, and this analysis shows that substantial gain can be achieved.
