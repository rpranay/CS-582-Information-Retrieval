Learning Comprehensible Conceptual User Models for User Adaptive Meta Web Search In course of the OySTER project our goal is to induce conceptual user models that allow for a transparent query refinement and information filtering in the domain of Www meta--search. User models which describe a user's interest with respect to an underlying ontology allow for a manual user model editing process and also pose a well defined problem for a conceptual inductive learning task. OySTER is a research prototype that is currently being developed at the university of Osnabruck. Introduction User Modeling and Machine Learning. User models represent assumptions about a user. User modeling systems infer user models from user interaction, store user models and induce new assumptions by reasoning about the models. These models are used within the system in order to adapt to the user. Furthermore, these models shall be accessible to the user --- they should be both understandable and manually modifyable. Incorporating machine learning into this framework often leads to intertwine...
