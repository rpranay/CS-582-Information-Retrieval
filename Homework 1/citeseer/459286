Enabling Technologies for Interoperability We present a new approach, which proposes to minimize  the numerous problems existing in order to have  fully interoperable GIS. We discuss the existence of  these heterogeneity problems and the fact that they  must be solved to achieve interoperability. These problems  are addressed on three levels: the syntactic, structural  and semantic level. In addition, we identify the  needs for an approach performing semantic translation  for interoperability and introduce a uniform description  of contexts. Furthermore, we discuss a conceptual  architecture Buster (Bremen University Semantic  Translation for Enhanced Retrieval) which can provide  intelligent information integration based on a reclassification  of information entities in a new context.  Lastly, we demonstrate our theories by sketching a real  life scenario.
