Awareness and Privacy in Mobile Wearable Computers. IPADS: Interpersonal Awareness Devices An Inter-Personal Awareness Device, or IPAD, is a handheld or wearable device designed to support awareness and collaboration between people who are in physical vicinity of each other. This paper describes three IPAD systems, comparing their characteristics and approaches to the problem of opportunistic meeting. The characteristics are identified according to the Steinfield et al. [SJP99] awareness classification. Some of these mechanisms are discussed and some improvements and ideas are proposed in order to improve the systems.  Key Words: CSCW, Wearable Computers, Awareness, IPAD, Mobility.  1. Introduction  Many studies about collaborative systems are concerned about the use of the desktop workstations and network technologies to provide support for distributed collaborative work and awareness. These systems however, are available on devices that are static and tied to the desk [LH98]. Recently, the development of mobile devices as wearable computers, cellular phones and PDAs (Perso...
