User Modeling for Information Access Based on Implicit Feedback User modeling can be used in information filtering and retrieval systems to improve the representation of a user's information needs. User models can be constructed by hand, or learned automatically based on feedback provided by the user about the relevance of documents that they have examined. By observing user behavior, it is possible to infer implicit feedback without requiring explicit relevance judgments. Previous studies based on Internet discussion groups (USENET news) have shown reading time to be a useful source of implicit feedback for predicting a user's preferences. The study reported in this paper extends that work by providing framework for considering alternative sources of implicit feedback, examining whether reading time is useful for predicting a user's preferences for academic and professional journal articles, and exploring whether retention behavior can usefully augment the information that reading time provides. Two user studies were conducted in which undergradua...
