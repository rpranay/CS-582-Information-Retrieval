State-Based SHOSLIF for Indoor Visual Navigation In this paper, we investigate vision-based navigation using the Self-organizing Hierarchical Optimal Subspace Learning and Inference Framework (SHOSLIF) that incorporates states and a visual attention mechanism. The problem is formulated as an observation-driven Markov model (ODMM) which is realized through recursive partitioning regression. A stochastic recursive partition tree (SRPT), which maps an preprocessed current input raw image and the previous state into the current state and the next control signal, is used for efficient recursive partitioning regression. The SRPT learns incrementally: each learning sample is learned or rejected "onthe -fly". The proposed scheme has been successfully applied to indoor navigation. Keywords: Vision-based navigation, incremental learning, eigen-subspace method, content-based retrieval, observation-driven Markov model, nearest neighbor regression.  1 1 Introduction  Much progress has been made in autonomous navigation of mobile robots, both ind...
