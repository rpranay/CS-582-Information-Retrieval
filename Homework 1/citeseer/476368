A hybrid projection based and radial basis function architecture: Initial values and global optimization We introduce a hybrid architecture of projection based units and radial basis functions  as a general function estimation scheme. In particular, we introduce an optimization  scheme which has several steps and assures a convergence to a useful solution.  During training a determination whether a Gaussian unit should be removed is applied.  This results in a final architecture with much smaller number of units. The  proposed global constrained optimization does not lead to overfitting which happens  when the RBF width becomes too small, this is achieved by a regularization mechanism.  Classification and regression results are demonstrated on various benchmark data  sets and compared with several variants of RBF networks. The most striking performance  improvement is achieved on the vowel data set [5].
