We propose a methodology for constructing exible negotiation  protocols based on joint actions and dialogue games. We view negotiation  as a combination of joint actions. Simple dialogue games that consist of  initiatives followed by responses function as `recipes for joint action' from  which larger interactions can be constructed coherently.  1 Introduction  Agent based software engineering is an active research area. One of its main challenges is to bridge theoretical models and practical applications. For example, there are many theoretical results on negotiation [11], but automated negotiation is still rare on the internet. Implementing negotiation protocols raises a number of practical questions. In particular, current negotiation systems are either closed or semi-closed. In closed and semi-closed environments, like in auctions, there is central control over the agents that can participate. In s...
