Using WG-Log to represent semistructured data: the example of OEM . In this paper we discuss the possibility to represent synthetically semistructured information via a loose notion of schema: we say that data are semistructured when, although some structure is present, it is not as strict, regular, or complete as the one required by the traditional database management systems. Our proposal is based on WG-Log, a graph based language for the representation of WWW site information. We show how information encoded in a typical semistructured information model, as OEM, can be represented and queried by means of the WG-Log language, and how the TSIMMIS and WG-Log Web Query System can be integrated to allow site content exploration and exploitation by means of WG-Log. 1 Introduction  We say that data are semistructured when, although some structure is present, it is not as strict, regular, or complete as the one required by the traditional database management systems (see [Abi97] for a survey on semistructured data). Information is semistructured also when...
