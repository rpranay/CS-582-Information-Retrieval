Methodologies for PVC Configuration in Heterogeneous ATM Environments Using Intelligent Mobile Agents Traditionally, the functionality enabling the configuration of Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs) in heterogeneous Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) environments has been accomplished through the use of client/server technologies. However, this approach suffers from a number of problems in the areas of flexibility, extensibility and efficiency, and as networks become increasingly complex and dynamic, the need for a new paradigm has become apparent. This paper is concerned with the analysis of a proposed solution wherein intelligent mobile agents are utilized to provide autonomous network configuration management functionality. Configuration methodologies based on a single mobile agent acting serially and multiple mobile agents acting in parallel are compared in terms of time duration and network load. The use of a small expert system to provide the intelligence needed to handle error situations is investigated. A test environment composed of three simulated ATM switch nodes is develop...
