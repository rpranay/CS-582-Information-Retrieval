Experiments in Meta-Level Learning with ILP When considering new datasets for analysis with machine  learning algorithms, we encounter the problem of choosing the algorithm  which is best suited for the task at hand. The aim of meta-level learning  is to relate the performance of different machine learning algorithms to  the characteristics of the dataset. The relation is induced on the basis  of empirical data about the performance of machine learning algorithms  on the different datasets.
