SIC: Satisfiability Checking for Integrity Constraints SIC is an interactive prototype to assist in the design of finitely satisfiable integrity constraints. Thus SIC addresses the constraint satisfiability problem during the schema design phase of a database. SIC combines two systems, a reasoning component and an interactive visual interface. This paper outlines the functionality of both components and the theoretical background and implementation aspects of the reasoning component.
