Learning of Kick in Artificial Soccer Soccer simulation is a suitable domain for research in artificial intelligence. This paper describes a new ball kicking skill, that uses case based learning. In many situations a single kick command is not sufficient to reach the desired ball movement. Hence a skill is needed, that finds a suitable sequence of kicks. The new kicking skill was developed for the AT Humboldt artificial soccer team.
