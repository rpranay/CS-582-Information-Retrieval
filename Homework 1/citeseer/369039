On the Integration of IR and Databases : Integration of information retrieval (IR) in database management  systems (DBMSs) has proven di#cult. Previous attempts to integration su#ered  from inherent performance problems, or lacked desirable separation between  logical and physical data models. To overcome these problems, we discuss a  database approach based on structural object-orientation. We implement IR  techniques using extensions in an object algebra called MOA. MOA has been  implemented on top of the database backend Monet, a state-of-the-art highperformance  database kernel with a binary relational interface. Our prototype  implementation of the inference network retrieval model using MOA and Monet  demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. We conclude with a discussion of  the advantages of our database design.  INTRODUCTION  Information retrieval (IR) is concerned with the retrieval of (usually text) documents that are likely to be relevant to the user's information need as expressed by his request (van Rijsb...
