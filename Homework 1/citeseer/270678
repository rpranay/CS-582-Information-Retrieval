Real-Time Scheduling for Distributed Agents Providing an environment for a software agent to execute  is very similar to building an operating system for  the execution of general purpose applications. In the  same fashion that an operating system provides a set  of services for the execution of a user request, an agent  framework provides a similar set of services for the execution  of agent actions. Such services include the ability  to communicate with other agents, maintaining the  current state of an executing agent, and selecting an  execution path from a set of possible execution paths.  The particular focus of this paper is the study of Soft  Real-Time agentscheduling in the context of a framework  for the execution of intelligent software agents;  acharacterization of agent performance; and developmentofanenvironment  for testing and comparing the  performance of agent activities. The agent architecture  used for this study, DECAF #Distributed Environment  Centered AgentFramework#, is a software toolkit for  the rapid d...
