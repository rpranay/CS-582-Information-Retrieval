A Behaviour-based Approach to Position Selection for Simulated Soccer Agents Selecting an optimal position for each soccer robot to move to in a robot football game is a challenging and complex task since the environment and robot motion are so dynamic and unpredictable. This paper provides an overview of behaviour-based position selection schemes used by Essex Wizards'99 simulated soccer team, a third place in RoboCup'99 simulator league at Stockholm. The focus concentrates on how each position selection behaviour is selected for individual robot agents. The factors that need to be considered and the architecture used to implement such position selection are also described. Finally the team performance at RoboCup'99 is examined, and future extensions are proposed.  1. Introduction  The Robot World Cup initiative (RoboCup) is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a uniform task, the game of soccer [4]. Some of the software technologies include design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisitio...
