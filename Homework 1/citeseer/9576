Optimization of Constrained Frequent Set Queries with 2-variable Constraints Currently, there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities in database management systems. As a first step towards this goal, in [15] we proposed an architecture for supporting constraint-based, human-centered, exploratory mining of various kinds of rules including associations, introduced the notion of constrained frequent set queries (CFQs), and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent and consequent separately, many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constraining the antecedent and consequent jointly, for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints are indispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is the subject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because: (i) in 2var constraints, both variables keep changing and, unlike 1-var constraints, there is no fixed target for pruning; (ii) as we show, "conv...
