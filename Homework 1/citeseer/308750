Long-Term Learning from User Behavior in Content-Based Image Retrieval This article describes an algorithm for obtaining knowledge about the importance of features  from analyzing user log les of a content-based image retrieval system (CBIRS). The  user log les from the usage of the Viper web demonstration system are analyzed over a period  of four months. Within this period about 3500 accesses to the system were made with almost  800 multiple image queries. All the actions of the users were logged in a le.  The analysis only includes multiple image queries of the system with positive and/or negative  input images, because only multiple image queries contain enough information for the  method described. Features frequently present in images marked together positively in the  same query step get a higher weighting, whereas features present in one image marked positively  and another image marked negatively in the same step get a lower weighting. The  Viper system oers a very large number of simple features. This allows the creation of exible  feature ...
