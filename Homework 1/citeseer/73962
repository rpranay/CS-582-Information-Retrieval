Supporting Flexibility. A Case-Based Reasoning Approach This paper presents a case-based reasoning system  TA3. We address the flexibility of the case-based reasoning process, namely flexible retrieval of relevant experiences, by using a novel similarity assessment theory. To exemplify the advantages of such an approach, we have experimentally evaluated the system and compared its performance to the performance of non-flexible version of TA3 and to other machine learning algorithms on several domains. Introduction  Flexible Computation  There are many situation when resources are scarce and when the system has to make decision as to how to proceed with further computation in order to make the right tradeoff between quality of the answer and resources needed. In several domains, such as medicine, robotics, financing, etc., if the answer to a query is not produced within a certain time limit it may become useless. Such family of problems has been a motivation for designing anytime algorithms (Dean & Boddy 1988; Frisch & Haddawy 1994), algorit...
