Reasoning With Inconsistency in Structured Text Reasoning with inconsistency involves some compromise on classical logic. There is a range  of proposals for logics (called paraconsistent logics) for reasoning with inconsistency each with  pros and cons. Selecting an appropriate paraconsistent logic for an application depends on  the requirements of the application. Here we review paraconsistent logics for the potentially  significant application area of technology for structured text. Structured text is a general  concept that is implicit in a variety of approaches to handling information. Syntactically, an  item of structured text is a number of grammatically simple phrases together with a semantic  label for each phrase. Items of structured text may be nested within larger items of structured  text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to parameterize a stereotypical  situation, and so a particular item of structured text is an instance of that stereotypical  situation. Much information is potentially available as st...
