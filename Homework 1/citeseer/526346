Computational Web Intelligence (CWI): Synergy of Computational Intelligence and Web Technology With explosive growth of e-Business on the Internet, and wireless networks, users face more and more challenging networks-based application problems in terms of intelligent eApplications. To increase the QoI (Quality of Intelligence) of eBusiness, we propose a new research area called Computational Web Intelligence (CWI) based on both Computational Intelligence (CI) and Web Technology (WT). Generally, the intelligent e-brainware using CWI techniques plays an important role in smart e-Business. In this paper, fundamental concepts, basic methods, major applications and future trends of CWI are described to briefly show a general framework of CWI from different aspects.
