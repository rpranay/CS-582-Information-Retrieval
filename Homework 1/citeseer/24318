Consistent Query Answers in Inconsistent Databases In this paper we consider the problem of the logical characterization of the notion of consistent answer in a relational database that may violate given integrity constraints. This notion is captured in terms of the possible repaired versions of the database. A method for computing consistent answers is given and its soundness and completeness (for some classes of constraints and queries) proved. The method is based on an iterative procedure whose termination for several classes of constraints is proved as well. 1 Introduction  Integrity constraints capture an important normative aspect of every database application. However, it is often the case that their satisfaction cannot be guaranteed, allowing for the existence of inconsistent database instances. In that case, it is important to know which query answers are consistent with the integrity constraints and which are not. In this paper, we provide a logical characterization of consistent query answers in relational databases that may...
