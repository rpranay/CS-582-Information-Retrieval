Reinforcement Learning for a Vision Based Mobile Robot Reinforcement learning systems improve behaviour based on scalar rewards from a critic. In this work vision based behaviours, servoing and wandering, are learned through a Q-learning method which handles continuous states and actions. There is no requirement for camera calibration, an actuator model, or a knowledgeable teacher. Learning through observing the actions of other behaviours improves learning speed. Experiments were performed on a mobile robot using a real-time vision system. 1 Introduction Collision free wandering and visual servoing are building blocks for purposeful robot behaviours such as foraging, target pursuit and landmark based navigation. Visual servoing consists of moving some part of a robot to a desired position using visual feedback [15]. Wandering is an environment exploration behaviour [6]. In this work we demonstrate real-time learning of wandering and servoing on a real robot. Learning eliminates the calibration process and leads to flexible behaviour....
