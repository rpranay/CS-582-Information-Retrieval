Data Quality in e-Business Applications In e-Business scenarios, an evaluation of the quality of exchanged  data is essential for developing service-based applications and  correctly performing cooperative activities. Data of low quality can spread  all over the cooperative system, but at the same time, improvement can  be based on comparing data, correcting them and disseminating high  quality data. In this paper, an XML-based broker service for managing  data quality in cooperative systems is presented, which selects the best  available data from different services. Such a broker also supports data  quality improvements based on feedbacks to source services.
