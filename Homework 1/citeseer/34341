Meta-Learning in Distributed Data Mining Systems: Issues and Approaches Data mining systems aim to discover patterns and extract useful information  from facts recorded in databases. A widely adopted approach to this  objective is to apply various machine learning algorithms to compute descriptive  models of the available data. Here, we explore one of the main  challenges in this research area, the development of techniques that scale up  to large and possibly physically distributed databases.  Meta-learning is a technique that seeks to compute higher-level classifiers  (or classification models), called meta-classifiers, that integrate in some principled  fashion multiple classifiers computed separately over different databases.  This study, describes meta-learning and presents the JAM system (Java Agents  for Meta-learning), an agent-based meta-learning system for large-scale data  mining applications. Specifically, it identifies and addresses several important  desiderata for distributed data mining systems that stem from their additional  complexity co...
