Projective Translations and Affine Stereo Calibration This paper investigates the structure of projective translations - rigid translations expressed as homographies in projective space. A seven parameter representation is proposed, which explicitly represents the geometric entities constraining and defining the translation. A practical algebraic method for estimating these parameters is developed. It provides affine calibration of a stereo rig, determines the translation axis, and allows projective translations to be composed. The practical effectiveness of the calibration is evaluated on synthetic and real image data.  1 Introduction  The recovery of structure and motion is a basic problem in machine vision. The difficulties increase when uncalibrated cameras are considered, since in this case metric information is missing. Nevertheless, the rigidity of 3D-motions imposes strong consistency constraints. This allows metric information to be extracted. Mathematically, given a set of points reconstructed in projective space, the effect of ...
