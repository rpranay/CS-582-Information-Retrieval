An Ejection Chain Approach for the Generalized Assignment Problem this paper, we propose an ejection chain approach under the framework of tabu search (TS) for the generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is known to be NP-hard (Sahni and Gonzalez 1976). GAP seeks a minimum cost assignment of n jobs to m agents subject to a resource constraint for each agent. Among various heuristic algorithms developed for GAP are: a combination of the greedy method and local search by Martello and Toth (1981, 1990); a tabu search and simulated annealing approach by Osman (1995); a genetic algorithm by Chu and Beasley (1997); VDS methods by Amini and Racer (1995) and Racer and Amini (1994); a tabu search approach by Laguna et al. (1995) (which is proposed for a generalization of GAP); a set partitioning heuristic by Cattrysse et al. (1994); a relaxation heuristic by Lorena and Narciso (1996); a GRASP and MAX-MIN ant system combined with local search and tabu search by Lourenco and Serra (1998); a linear relaxation heuristic by Trick (1992); and so on. Many exact algorithms have also been proposed (e.g., Nauss 2003, Savelsbergh 1997). A simpler version of an ejection chain approach has also been proposed for the GAP in Laguna et al. (1995). Our ejection chain is based on the idea described in Glover (1997)
