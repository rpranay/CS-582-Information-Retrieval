Formal Concepts of Learning Systems Validation in Use In the problem area of evaluating complex software  systems, there are two distinguished areas of research,  development, and application identified by the two  buzzwords validation and verification, respectively.  From the perspective adopted by the authors  (cf. (O'Keefe & O'Leary 1993), e.g.), verification is  usually more formally based and, thus, can be supported  by formal reasoning tools like theorem provers,  for instance.  The scope of verification approaches is limited by the  difficulty of finding a sufficiently complete formalization  to built upon. In paramount realistic problem  domains, validation seems to be more appropriate, although  it is less stringent in character and, therefore,  validation results are often less definite.  The aim of this paper is to exemplify a validation approach  based on a clear and thoroughly formal theory.  In this way, validation and verification should be  brought closer to each other, for the benefit of a concerted  action towards depend...
