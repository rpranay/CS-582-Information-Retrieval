Corpus-Based Stemming using Co-occurrence of Word Variants Stemming is used in many information retrieval (IR) systems to reduce variant word forms  to common roots. It is one of the simplest applications of natural language processing to IR,  and one of the most effective in terms of user acceptance and consistent, though small, retrieval  improvements. Current stemming techniques do not, however, reflect the language use in specific  corpora and this can lead to occasional serious retrieval failures. We propose a technique  for using corpus-based word variant co-occurrence statistics to modify or create a stemmer. The  experimental results generated using English newspaper and legal text and Spanish text demonstrate  the viability of this technique and its advantages relative to conventional approaches.
