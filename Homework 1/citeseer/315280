Planned Disconnections for Mobile Databases As mobility permeates todays computing environment, we envision application infrastructures that will increasingly use mobile technologies. Traditional database applications will need to integrate mobile entities: people and computers. In this paper, we develop a distributed database framework for mobile environments. A key requirement in such an environment is to support frequent connection and disconnection of database sites.  1 Introduction  As mobility permeates into todays computing and communication arena, we envision application infrastructures that will increasingly rely on mobile technologies. Current mobility applications tend to have a large central server and use mobile platforms only as caching devices. We want to elevate the role of mobile computers to first class entities in the sense that they allow the mobile user work/update capabilities independent of a central server. In such an environment, several mobile computers may collectively form the entire distributed syste...
