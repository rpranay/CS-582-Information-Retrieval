A Geometric Framework for Specifying Spatiotemporal Objects We present a framework for specifying spatiotemporal objects using spatial and temporal objects, and a geometric transformation. We define a number of classes of spatiotemporal objects and study their closure properties.  1 Introduction  Many natural or man-made phenomena have both a spatial and a temporal extent. Consider for example, a forest fire or property histories in a city. To store information about such phenomena in a database one needs appropriate data modeling constructs. We claim that a new concept, spatiotemporal object, is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a very general framework for specifying spatiotemporal objects. To define a spatiotemporal object we need a spatial object, a temporal object, and a continuous geometric transformation (specified using a parametric representation) that determines the image of the spatial object at different time instants belonging to the temporal object. In this framework, a number of classes of spatiotemporal objects arise quite ...
