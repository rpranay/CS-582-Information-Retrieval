Extended Experimental Explorations Of The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Learning This is an extended report focussing on experimental results to explore the necessity of user guidance in case-based knowledge acquisition. It is covering a collection of theoretical investigations as well. The methodology of our approach is quite simple: We choose a well-understood area which is tailored to case-based knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, we choose a prototypical case-based learning algorithm which is obviously suitable for the problem domain under consideration. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations. The main experiments deal with the difficulties of learning from randomly arrange...
