Agent-Based Modeling for Holonic Manufacturing Systems with Fuzzy Control Agent-based systems technologies are of emerging interest in the specification and implementation of complex systems. This article introduces the CASA agent development system which seamlessly combines the BDI (Belief Desire Intention) approach with the FIPA agent communication language standard and an integrated specification of fuzzy controllers. The behavior of agents is defined by strategies which basically correspond to extended guarded horn clauses with priorities. The presented concepts are introduced by an example from Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). The example gives the specification of a fuzzy controller for a manufacturing station in the context of a holonic manufacturing system (HMS).  1 Introduction  Agent-based systems technologies in the sense of distributed computing is an area of emerging interest in the domain of complex systems design. The agent-based paradigm can be seen as a real enhancement of the objectoriented paradigm where objects become autonomous, ...
