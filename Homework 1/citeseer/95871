Query Rewriting for Semistructured Data We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL, a language for querying semistructured data. We develop and present an algorithm that, given a semistructured query q and a set of semistructured views V, finds rewriting queries, i.e., queries that access the views and produce the same result as q.  Our algorithm is based on appropriately generalizing containment mappings, the chase, and unification  -- techniques that were developed for structured, relational data. We also develop an algorithm for equivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete for TSL, i.e., it always finds every TSL rewriting query of q, and we discuss its complexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use available structural constraints (such as DTDs) to find more opportunities for query rewriting. We currently incorporate the algorithm in the TSIMMIS system. 1 Introduction  Recently, many semistructured data models, query and view definition languages have been proposed [2...
