Secure Mobile Agent using Strong Non-designated Proxy Signature It is expected that mobile agent will be widely used for electronic  commerce as an important key technology. If a mobile agent can  sign a message in a remote server on behalf of a customer without exposing  his/her private key, it can be used not only to search for special  products or services, but also to make a contract with a remote server. To  construct mobile agents, [KBC00] used an RSA-based undetachable signature  scheme, but it does not provide server's non-repudiation because  the undetachable signature does not contain server's signature.  Mobile agent is a very good application example of proxy signature,  and the undetachable signature can be considered as an example of  proxy signature. In this paper we show that secure mobile agent can be  constructed using strong non-designated proxy signature [LKK01] which  represents both the original signer's (customer) and the proxy signer's  (remote server) signatures. We provide RSA-based and Schnorr-based  constructions of secure mobile agent, and moreover we show that the  Schnorr-based scheme can be used very eciently in multi-proxy mobile  agent situation.  Keywords. Secure mobile agent, strong non-designated proxy signature,  multi-proxy signature.  1
