Array-Based Evaluation of Multi-Dimensional Queries in Object-Relational Database Systems Since multi-dimensional arrays are a natural data structure for supporting multi-dimensional queries, and object-relational database systems support multi-dimensional array ADTs, it is natural to ask if a multi-dimensional array-based ADT can be used to improve O/R DBMS performance on multi-dimensional queries. As an initial step toward answering this question, we have implemented a multi-dimensional array in the Paradise ObjectRelational DBMS. In this paper we describe the implementation of this compressed-array ADT, and explore its performance for queries including star-join consolidations and selections. We show that in many cases the array ADT can provide significantly higher performance than can be obtained by applying techniques such as bitmap indices and star-join algorithms to relational tables. 1 Introduction  Multi-dimensional data analysis has been around for at least twenty years [OR95], but has recently taken the spotlight in the context of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Process...
