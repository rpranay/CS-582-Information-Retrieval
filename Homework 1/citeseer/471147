Monotonic and Residuated Logic Programs In this paper we define the rather general framework of Monotonic Logic Programs, where the main results of (definite) logic programming are validly extrapolated. Whenever defining new logic programming extensions, we can thus turn our attention to the stipulation and study of its intuitive algebraic properties within the very general setting. Then, the existence of a minimum model and of a monotonic immediate consequences operator is guaranteed, and they are related as in classical logic programming. Afterwards we study the more restricted class of residuated logic programs which is able to capture several quite distinct logic programming semantics. Namely: Generalized Annotated Logic Programs, Fuzzy Logic Programming, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs, and Possibilistic Logic Programming. We provide the embedding of possibilistic logic programming.
