Multi-modal Identity Verification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) to formulate a decision fusion problem encountered in the design of a multi-modal identity verification system as a particular classification problem, (2) to propose to solve this problem by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The multi-modal identity verification system under consideration is built of d modalities in parallel, each one delivering as output a scalar number, called score, stating how well the claimed identity is verified. A fusion module receiving as input the d scores has to take a binary decision: accept or reject identity. This fusion problem has been solved using Support Vector Machines. The performances of this fusion module have been evaluated and compared with other proposed methods on a multimodal database, containing both vocal and visual modalities.
