Theme-Based Retrieval of Web News Efficient information retrieval of highly dynamic information, such as Web news, is a complex task. As a result, search and retrieval environments for continuously updated news from other sources than the largest media conglomerates are almost absent on the Internet. Global search engines do not index or classify news information from smaller network communities. To address this problem, I developed NewsSearch, a news information management environment designed to improve retrieval efficiency of online news for the smaller networked communities.  NewsSearch search achieves its goal through a combination of techniques:  . Multiple indexing queues, defining multiple gathering schedules, to deal with different publication periodicities.  . Information Retrieval techniques to news, in order to classify them into a pre-defined set of themes.  . Support Vector Machines, which proved to be a fast and reliable classification technique.  NewsSearch proved to be a scalable solution with acceptable storage needs even while managing a fairly large collection of daily publications. A combination of fine tuning of training strategies, noise filtering of Web news documents and multiple classifications, enable NewsSearch to achieve a classification accuracy of 95%.
