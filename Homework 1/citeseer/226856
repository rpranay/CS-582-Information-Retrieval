Query Optimization in Kess - An Ontology-Based KBMS This paper presents an approach for the implementation of query optimization techniques in Kess  (the Knowledge Enhanced SQL Server). Kess is a Knowledge Database Management System (KBMS)  that uses a semantic ontology-based data model. We have classified our query optimization techniques  in two different categories: 1. semantic-based and 2. data access path related. These techniques use  a compiler optimization approach to simplify query predicates and use caching to optimize memory  hierarchy performance for the evaluation of ontology-related predicates. This work also presents the  results of the implementation of such optimizations in Kess in the form of a performance analysis.  1 Introduction  This paper presents an approach for the implementation of query optimization techniques in Kess (the Knowledge Enhanced SQL Server). Its main novel feature, when compared to conventional SQL servers, is the capability to store knowledge and to use it in a manner that is analogous to deducti...
