Run-time Detection in Parallel and Distributed Systems: An Application to Safety-Critical Applications As systems are becoming more complex, there is increasing interest in their runtime analysis, understanding their dynamic behavior and possibly controling it as well. This paper describes complex distributed and parallel applications that use run-time analyses to attain scalability improvements with respect to the amount and complexity of the data transmitted, transformed, and shared among different application components. Such improvements are derived from using database techniques when manipulating data streams. Namely, by imposing a relational model on a data stream, filters and constraints on the stream may be expressed in the form of database queries evaluated against the data events comprising the stream. Streams may then be filtered using runtime optimization techniques derived from query optimization methods. This paper also presents a tool, termed Cnet, which offers (1) means for the dynamic creation of queries and their application to distributed data streams, (2) permits the...
