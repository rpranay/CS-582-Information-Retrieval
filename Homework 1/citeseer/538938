StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM) - Active Storage Hierarchy Database System and Applications This paper describes how database systems can use and exploit a cost-effective active storage hierarchy. By active storage hierarchy we mean a database system that uses all storage media (i.e. optical, tape, and disk) to store and retrieve data and not just disk. We describe and emphasize the active part, whereby all storage types are used to store raw data that is converted to strategic business information. We describe an evolution to the Data Warehouse concept, called Atomic Data Store, whereby atomic data is stored in the database system. Atomic data is defined as storing all the historic data values and executing queries against the historic queries. We also describe a Data Warehouse information collection, flow and central data store Hub-and-Spoke architecture, used to feed data into Data Marts. We also describe a commercial product; StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM). RM is a commercial relational database system that executes SQL queries directly against data stored on the storage hierarchy (i.e. tape, optical, disk). We conclude with a brief overview of a real world AT&T Call Detail Warehouse (CDW) case study.
