Scheduling Queries on Tape-resident Data Advances in storage technology have made near-line tertiary storage a viable alternative for  database and data warehouse systems. Tertiary storage systems are employed in cases where secondary  storage can not satisfy the data handling requirements or tertiary storage is more cost effective  option. Tertiary storage devices have traditionally been used as archival storage. The new application  domains require on-demand retrieval of data from these devices. This paper investigates issues in  optimizing I/O time for a query whose data resides on automated tertiary storage containing multiple  storage devices. We model the problem as a limited storage parallel two-machine flow-shop scheduling  problem with additional constraints. Given a query, we establish an upper bound on the number  of storage devices for an optimal I/O schedule and provide experimental proof for it. For queries  that access small amounts of data from multiple media, we derive an optimal schedule analytically.  For q...
