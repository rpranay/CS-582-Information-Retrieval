Incremental Document Clustering for Web Page Classification Introduction  We consider document clustering for Web pages. Traditionally, the document classification task is carried out manually. In order to assign a document to an appropriate class, people would analyze the contents of the document first. Therefore a large amount of human effort would be required. There has been some research work conducted on automatic text classification. One approach is to learn the text classifiers by using the machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms are based on a set of positive and negative training examples for learning the text classifiers. The quality of the resulting classifiers highly depends on the fitness of the training examples. There are many terms and classes in the World Wide Web (or just the Web), and many new terms and concepts are created everyday. It is quite impossible to have domain experts to identify training examples to learn a classifier for each text class in the above manner.  In order to make the document cl
