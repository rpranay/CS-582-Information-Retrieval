Parsing As Information Compression By Multiple Alignment, Unification And Search: SP52 This article presents and discusses examples illustrating aspects of the proposition, described in the accompanying article (Wolff, 1998), that parsing may be understood as information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search (ICMAUS). The later examples show that the multiple alignment framework as described in the accompanying article has expressive power which is comparable with other `context sensitive' systems used to represent the syntax of natural languages. In all the examples, the SP52 model, described in the accompanying article, is capable of finding an alignment which is intuitively `correct' and assigning to it a `compression score' which is higher than for any other alignment. The congruance which has been found between this range of alignments produced by a system which is dedicated to information compression and what is judged to be `correct' in terms of linguistic intuition lends support to the hypothesis that linguistic intuition is itself a product o...
