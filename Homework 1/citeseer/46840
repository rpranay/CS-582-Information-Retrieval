Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine Function approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest--descent minimization. A general gradient--descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least--squares, least--absolute--deviation, and Huber--M loss functions for regression, and multi--class logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are decision trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of decision trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire 1996, and Friedman, Has...
