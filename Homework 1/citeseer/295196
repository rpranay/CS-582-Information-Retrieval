Task-Oriented Collaboration with Embodied Agents in Virtual Worlds   We are working toward animated agents that can collaborate with human students in virtual worlds. The agent's objective is to help students learn to perform physical, procedural tasks, such as operating and maintaining equipment. Like most of the previous research on task-oriented dialogues, the agent (computer) serves as an expert that can provide guidance to a human novice. Research on such dialogues dates back more than twenty years (Deutsch 1974), and the subject remains an active research area (Allen et al. 1996; Lochbaum 1994; Walker 1996). However, most of that research has focused solely on verbal dialogues, even though the earliest studies clearly showed the ubiquity of nonverbal communication in human task-oriented dialogues (Deutsch 1974). To allow a wider variety of interactions among agents and human students, we use virtual reality (Durlach and Mavor 1995); agents and students cohabit a threedimensional, interactive, simulated mock-up of the student'
