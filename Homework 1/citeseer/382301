Applying Formal Concepts to Learning Systems Validation In the problem area of evaluating complex software systems, there are two distinguished areas of research, development, and application  identified by the two buzzwords validation and verification, respectively. From the perspective adopted by the authors, verification is usually  more formally based and, thus, can be supported by formal reasoning tools like theorem provers, for instance.  The scope of verification approaches is limited by the difficulty of finding a sufficiently complete formalization to built upon. In paramount realistic problem domains, validation seems to be more appropriate, although it is less stringent in character and, therefore, validation results are often less definite. The aim of this paper is to exemplify a validation approach based on a clear and thoroughly formal theory. In this way, validation and  verification should be brought closer to each other.  To allow for precise and sufficiently clear results, the authors have selected the applicatio...
