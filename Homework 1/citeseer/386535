Performance Analysis of Mobile Agents for Filtering Data Streams on Wireless Networks Wireless networks are an ideal environment for mobile agents, since their mobility allows them to move across an unreliable link to reside on a wired host, next to or closer to the resources that they need to use. Furthermore, clientspecific data transformations can be moved across the wireless link and run on a wired gateway server, reducing bandwidth demands. In this paper we examine the tradeoffs faced when deciding whether to use mobile agents in a datafiltering application where numerous wireless clients filter information from a large data stream arriving across the wired network. We develop an analytical model and use parameters from filtering experiments conducted during a U.S. Navy Fleet Battle Experiment (FBE) to explore the model's implications.  1. Introduction  Mobile agents are programs that can migrate from host to host in a network of computers, at times and to places of their own choosing. Unlike applets, both the code and the execution state (heap and stack) move with...
