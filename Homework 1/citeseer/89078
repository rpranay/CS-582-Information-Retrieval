Confluence of Computer Vision and Interactive Graphics for Augmented Reality . Augmented reality #AR# is a technology in which a user's view of the real world  is enhanced or augmented with additional information generated from a computer model.  Using AR technology, users can interact with a combination of real and virtual objects in  a natural way. This paradigm constitutes the core of a very promising new technology for  many applications. However, before it can be applied successfully, AR has to ful#ll very strong  requirements including precise calibration, registration and tracking of sensors and objects in  the scene, as well as a detailed overall understanding of the scene.  At ECRCwe see computer vision and image processing technology play an increasing role  in acquiring appropriate sensor and scene models. To balance robustness with automation,  weintegrate automatic image analysis with both interactive user assistance and input from  magnetic trackers and CAD-models. Also, in order to meet the requirements of the emerging  global information society...
