Hierarchical Discriminant Regression The main motivation of this paper is to propose a new classification and regression method for challenging high dimensional data. The proposed new technique casts classification problems (class labels as output) and regression problems (numeric values as output) into a unified regression problem. This unified view enables classification problems to use numeric information in the output space that is available for regression problems but are traditionally not readily available for classification problems -- distance metric among clustered class labels for coarse and fine classifications. A doubly clustered subspace-based hierarchical discriminating regression (HDR) method is proposed in this work. The major characteristics include: (1) Clustering is performed in both output space and input space at each internal node and thus the term "doubly clustered." Clustering in the output space provides virtual labels for computing clusters in the input space. (2) Discriminants in the input spa...
