Design-to-Criteria Scheduling: Real-Time Agent Control Design-to-Criteria builds custom schedules for agents that  meet hard temporal constraints, hard resource constraints,  and soft constraints stemming from soft task interactions or  soft commitments made with other agents. Design-to-Criteria  is designed specifically for online application -- it copes with  exponential combinatorics to produce these custom schedules  in a resource bounded fashion. This enables agents to respond  to changes in problem solving or the environment as  they arise.  Introduction  Complex autonomous agents operating in open, dynamic environments must be able to address deadlines and resource limitations in their problem solving. This is partly due to characteristics of the environment, and partly due to the complexity of the applications typically handled by software agents in our research. In open environments, requests for service can arrive at the local agent at any time, thus making it difficult to fully plan or predict the agent's future workload. In dyn...
