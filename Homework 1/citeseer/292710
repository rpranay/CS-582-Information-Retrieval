Use Case Maps as a Feature Description Notation . We propose Use Case Maps (UCMs) as a notation for describing features. UCMs capture functional requirements in terms of causal scenarios bound to underlying abstract components. This particular view proved very useful in the description of a wide range of reactive and telecommunications systems. This paper presents some of the most interesting constructs and benefits of the notation in relation to a question on a User Requirements Notation recently approved by ITU-T Study Group 10, which will lead to a new Recommendation by 2003. Tool support, current research on UCMs, and related notations are also discussed.  1 Introduction  The modeling of reactive systems requires an early emphasis on behavioral aspects such as interactions between the system and the external world (including the users), on the cause-to-e#ect relationships among these interactions, and on intermediate activities performed by the system. Scenarios are particularly good at representing such aspects so that various ...
