Algorithms for Temporal Query Operators in XML Databases The contents of an XML database or XML/Web data warehouse is seldom static. New documents  are created, documents are deleted, and more important: documents are updated. In many  cases, we want to be able to search in historical versions, retrieve documents valid at a certain  time, query changes to documents, etc. This can be supported by extending the system with temporal  database features. In this paper we describe the new query operators needed in order to  support an XML query language which supports temporal operations. We also describe the algorithms  which can make efficient implementation of these query operators possible.  Keywords: XML, temporal databases, query processing  1
