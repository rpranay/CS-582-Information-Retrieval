Markov Techniques for Object Localization With Force-Controlled Robots This paper deals with object localization with forcecontrolled robots in the Bayesian framework [1]. It describes a method based on Markov Localization techniques with a Monte Carlo implementation applied for solving 3D (6 degrees of freedom) global localization problems with force-controlled robots. The approach was successfully applied to problems such as the recursive localization of a box by a robot manipulator.
