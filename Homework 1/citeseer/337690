On Decidability of Boundedness Property for Regular Path Queries The paper studies the evaluation of regular path queries on semi-structured data, i.e. path queries of the form find all objects reachable by path whose labels form a word in r where r is a regular expression. We use local information expressed in the form of path constraints in the optimization of path expression queries. These constraints are of the form r ae w where r is a regular language and w is a word
