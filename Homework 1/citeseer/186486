Design Issues for Mixed-Initiative Agent Systems This paper addresses the effect of mixed-initiative systems on multiagent systems design. A mixed-initiative system is one in which humans interact directly with software agents in a collaborative approach to problem solving. There are two main levels at which multiagent systems are designed: the domain level and the individual agent level. At the domain level, there are few unique challenges to mixedinitiative system design. However, at the individual agent level, the agent itself must be designed to interact with the human and the agent system, integrating the two into a single system. Introduction  Much of the current research related to intelligent agents has focused on the capabilities and structure of individual agents. However, in order to solve complex problems, these agents must work cooperatively with other agents in a heterogeneous environment. This is the domain of  Multiagent Systems. In multiagent systems, we are interested in the coordinated behavior of a system of indiv...
