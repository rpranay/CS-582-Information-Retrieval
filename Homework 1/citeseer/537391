Designing Data Warehouses with OO Conceptual Models ions of  our work. We believe that our innovative approach  provides a theoretical foundation for the use of OO  databases and object-relational databases in data  warehouses, MDB, and OLAP applications.  We use UML to design data warehouses because it  considers an information system's structural and  dynamic properties at the conceptual level more naturally  than do classic approaches such as the EntityRelationship  model. Further, UML provides powerful  mechanisms---such as the Object Constraint Language   and the Object Query Language    ---for embedding data  warehouse constraints and initial user requirements in  the conceptual model. This approach to modeling a  data warehouse system yields simple yet powerful  extended UML class diagrams that represent main data  warehouse properties at the conceptual level.  MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODELING PROPERTIES  Multidimensional modeling structures information  into facts and dimensions. We define a fact as an item  of interest for an enterpri
