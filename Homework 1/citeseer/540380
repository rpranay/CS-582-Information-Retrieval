C4-1: Building a community hierarchy for the Web based on Bipartite Graphs In this paper we propose an approach to extract and relate the communities by considering a community signature as a group of content creators that manifests itself as a set of interlinked pages. We abstract a community signature as a group of pages that form a dense bipartite graph (DBG), and proposed an algorithm to extract the DBGs from the given data set. Also, using the proposed approach, the extracted communities can be grouped to form a high-level communities. We apply the proposed algorithm on 10 GB TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) data set and extract a three-level community hierarchy. The extracted community hierarchy facilitates an easy analysis of low-level communities and provides a way to understand the sociology of the Web.
