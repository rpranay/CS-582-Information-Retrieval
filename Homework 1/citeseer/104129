Improving Retrieval on Imperfect Speech Transcriptions This paper presents the results from adding several forms of query expansion to our retrieval system running on transcriptions of broadcast news from the 1997 TREC-7 spoken document retrieval track. 1  Introduction  Retrieving documents which originated as speech is complicated by the presence of errors in the transcriptions. If some method of increasing retrieval performance despite these errors could be found, then even low-accuracy recognisers could be used as part of a successful spoken document retrieval (SDR) system. This paper presents results using four query expansion techniques described in [3] on 8 different sets of transcriptions generated for the 1997 TREC-7 SDR evaluation. The baseline retrieval system and the techniques used for query expansion are described in section 2, the transcriptions on which the experiments were performed in section 3 and results and further discussion are offered in section 4. 2  Retrieval Systems  2.1  Baseline System (BL)  Our baseline system ...
