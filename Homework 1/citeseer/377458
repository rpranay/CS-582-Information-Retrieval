On-line 3D gesture recognition utilising dissimilarity measures In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), gesture recognition is becoming increasingly important as a mode of communication, in addition to the more common visual, aural and oral modes, and is of particular interest to designers of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems for people with disabilities. A complete microcomputer system is described, GesRec3D, which facilitates the data acquisition, segmentation, learning, and recognition of 3-Dimensional arm gestures. The gesture data is acquired from a Polhemus electro-magnetic tracker system, where sensors are placed on the finger, wrist and elbow of one arm. Coded gestures are linked to user-defined text, to be typed or spoken by a text-to-speech engine, which is integrated into the system. A segmentation method and an algorithm for classification are both presented, which includes acceptance/rejection thresholds based on intra-class and inter-class dissimilarity measures. Results of recognition hits, confusion ...
