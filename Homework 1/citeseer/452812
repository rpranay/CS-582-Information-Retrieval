Pedagogical Content Knowledge in a Tutorial Dialogue System to Support Self-Explanation We are engaged in a research project to create a tutorial dialogue system that helps students learn through self-explanation. Our current prototype is able to analyze students' general explanations of their problem-solving steps, stated in their own words, recognize the types of omissions that we often see in these explanations, and provide feedback. Our approach to architectural tradeoffs is to equip the system with a sophisticated NLU component but to keep dialogue management simple. The system has a knowledge-based NLU component, which performed with 81% accuracy in a preliminary evaluation study. The system's approach to dialogue management can be characterised as "classify and react". In each dialogue cycle, the system classifies the student input with respect to a hierarchy of explanation categories that represent common ways of stating complete or incomplete explanations of geometry rules. The system then provides feedback based on that classification. We consider what extensions are necessary or desirable in order to make the dialogues more robust.
