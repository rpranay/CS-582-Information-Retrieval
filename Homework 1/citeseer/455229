Group Task Analysis for Groupware Usability Evaluations Techniques for inspecting the usability of groupware applications have recently been proposed. These techniques focus on the mechanics of collaboration rather than the work context in which a system is used, and offer time and cost savings by not requiring actual users or fully-functional prototypes. Although these techniques are valuable, adding information about task and work context could improve the quality of inspection results. We introduce a method for analysing group tasks that can be used to add context to discount groupware evaluation techniques. Our method allows for the specification of collaborative scenarios and tasks by considering the mechanics of collaboration, levels of coupling during task performance, and variability in task execution. We describe how this type of task analysis could be used in a new inspection technique based on cognitive walkthrough.
